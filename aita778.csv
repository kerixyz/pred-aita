0,1jxt7ww,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking out a homeless woman from the hotel I work at?,"So, I work at a 5\* hotel and more than a month ago, a woman came to the lobby at around 22:00 and asked if she could stay for a while inside. She was presentable and polite, so we agreed. At around 4AM, she left. The day after, she came back with the same request and again we allowed her to stay and sleep for a while, until she left at around 5AM. This kept on repeating for the next days and she started coming earlier, asking for food and drinks from the bar, and staying until later and asking for breakfast in the morning. We got a warning from our supervisors saying that this cannot keep on happening, and the next day when she came again (3 weeks after her first appearance), we had to kick her out at around 2AM. However, she kept on coming every day.

She has now been coming to the hotel every night for 5 weeks straight, where she has asked more than once if she could shower in one of the rooms, storage her heavy bags which she carries every night and even paid for a room (more than 200$ per night) in one of the nights. We have offered to help her several times, giving her recommendations for homeless shelters and the like, but she keeps on denying. The reception team as even offered to get her a room at a cheap hotel, to which she says no, and she claims to have no friends or family that can help her.

The part I cannot understand is: she always has clean clothes, smells nice and is polite. She often uses her Macbook and iPhone at the reception and has never disturbed anyone. I know from a logistics point of view, we can give her shelter and leftover food, but it's part of the hotel's policy that NO ONE can sleep in the lobby, not even guests. In the last few times we had to kick her out, she complains that no woman should be left alone in the streets at night and it really makes me feel like an asshole to ask her to leave.

So, AITA?

Edit: I should add that she is very likely to have a mental illness. Her speech is incoherent, she has told different versions of her story several times and is very often confused."
1,1jxt2o7,Not the A-hole,AITA for making a game based on an idea me and a friend made years ago?,"Basically back in 2021 me and a friend had an idea to make a game but we never really got through with it and it was all left in various unfinished prototypes that never got too far, a few months ago, i decided to pick back up the idea as it had been a really long time and i wanted to give it enough justice in the way of at least making it a somewhat finished game that had a coherent structure, the moment i showed this to my friend, he started remaking everything i had done for it but with his detailing style, scripting style, etc...

Now, he wants me to completely stop making mine and practically copy most of the things i had done for my version of the game (which he already has without asking me once and henceforth without my permission) and i dont really know how to proceed with it as i dont want to give him full control as i simply dont see it right and i have no intentions of monetizing the project since all i do is passion projects that i make for fun.

I just want to continue the project and if he wants to he can also make his own version, i have no problem with both versions co-existing and i'd be glad to help him with his own version after im done with my current demo of my own.

Am i the asshole?"
2,1jxrssb,Asshole,AITA for preferring that my uncle teach me to drive than my dad and refusing to tell my dad why?,"Throwaway because I know at least one of my sisters uses reddit and I really don’t want this to get back to my dad. My(19F) dad(45M) has been badgering me to learn to drive for the last 2 years and I’ve been resistant to the idea because of multiple reasons. Partly the cost. Average lesson in my area is like £40 per hour and because I’ve got a part-time job my dad wants me to contribute to it. It’s my money and I don’t really see why I should have to pay for something I don’t even want to do so I didn’t but eventually he gave me an ultimatum of either learning to drive or pay rent to them (I live at home). 

I don’t think I can focus for long enough to be safe about it so I know I’d be shit at it. The idea of being in charge of something that could kill someone really freaks me out, and I don’t really trust myself with the responsibility. When I tried to explain this to my dad, he just gave me empty reassurances about how I shouldn’t let my anxiety hold me back. I think if I can’t stand even the thought of it, I’m not gonna be much better in practice. 

So I chose to pay rent. Public transport isn’t awful where I live and I don't mind having to leave the house 20 minutes earlier than I would with a car. This clearly wasn’t what he wanted though because he called me stubborn and got all passive aggressive and pissy at me for a while. Eventually my dad sat me down and told me the reason he wanted me to learn to drive was because it opens up a lot of doors in the world or something and he was willing to entirely pay for the driving lessons, and teach me some stuff himself in car park before the lessons began so I wouldn’t be as nervous. I’m sick of arguing so I caved. He seemed really pleased by this and told me he’d always wanted to teach his kid to drive (I’m the eldest).

Then I started having anxiety attacks about accidentally killing my dad. A few days after we talked, I told my dad I would only learn if my uncle (38M who lives pretty close to us and I don’t think he has anything better to do and would probably agree) taught me instead. He got pretty upset and honestly seemed insulted, especially because I kept just brushing him off or shutting down when he asked why. I couldn’t tell him though, because I know it sounds cruel and cold but the honest reason is that I’d rather my uncle die than him. Realistically, I know it’s not actually likely anything serious will happen but I couldn’t forgive myself if I risked my dad’s life. Obviously I’d care if my uncle died, but we’re not as close as me and my dad and he’s a bit of a prick anyway. I think I’d probably drive better if I wasn’t worrying about my dad the whole time on top of the driving anxiety. 

Now my dad’s mad at me and the only times we’ve spoken in the last week have been either fighting or awkward. I really just wish he’d let it go because I don’t want to explain and I’d be learning to drive anyway, but at the same time I’ve been feeling guilty ever since. AITA?

3,1jxrk9e,Not the A-hole,AITA for indirectly establishing a boundary with my stepdad?,"I (F20) am currently in a situation where my mom (F48) and my stepdad (M40) aren't really speaking to me and I want to know if I'm in the right or wrong.

Friday morning, my stepdad kept coming into my room (I sleep with my door closed) with my dog playing with him, all the while roughly patting on me to rile him up (for reference, my dog is a year old so he's pretty young and energetic). He did this THREE TIMES while I was trying to sleep in as I didn't have school on Fridays. The third time however, was where this story takes a turn.

For context -- so this part of the story makes sense -- I used to live with my abusive father and his wife's children used to come into my room, unannounced and uninvited, touch and sometimes steal my stuff. This caused me to be very territorial with my belongings (silly, I know).

So he jokingly says to my puppy, ""Let's take her stuff!"" and he takes my Wii remote and puts it in his pocket, my stuffed cow and my Wii U gamepad. He turns it on and kind of starts fucking with it and I start to panic because my stuff is being touched. After he leaves, I send a text message to my mom saying, ""he (my stepdad) keeps touching my friggin stuff and im afraid to speak up about it without him getting mad. it's a huge boundary of mine."" She messages back saying ""what the fuck"" ""he's having fun and you're ruining it"". Then she tells me HE READ HER FUCKING MESSAGE and I hear start going off, cursing and mumbling to himself (this is something he always does when he's angered and it greatly annoys me and my mother). My mom then messages me with things like ""why do you always do this"" ""you shouldn't have said that"" and that he was having fun and joking around (which he doesn't really do with me). Now, he wants nothing to do with me and is angry with me. My mom is also upset but seems to want to move on from the situation but both of them aren't really speaking to me. My stepdad keeps mocking/mimicking me and bringing up what happened causing my mom to yell at him to stop and doesn't want to talk about it anymore. Now he gives me glares and does that obnoxious sigh thing when someone who doesn't like you sees you come around and now I feel guilty.

I firmly believe this situation could've been prevented or not have happened at all but all I did was state a boundary and I upset everyone. my boyfriend, my best friend and her sister believe I'm not in the wrong and that my stepdad could've handled the situation better. So AITA? "
4,1jxr9tf,Not the A-hole,AITA for considering a business that competes with my friend’s side hustle?,"TL;DR: My friend runs a side hustle inspecting boats for buyers. I want to start a platform connecting people in our region with services like his, but he says it’s disloyal and feels like a betrayal.

Hi everyone,

My friend (let’s call him John) and I are both men in our mid-30s. We’ve been close friends since meeting in college.

We live in a region surrounded by water, so boats are very popular here. You can pick up a basic fishing boat with a small engine for a few thousand dollars. Think functional and modest, not luxury yachts.

Both John and I have always been interested in boats and engines. However, I’ll admit that John’s knowledge is much deeper than mine, which will be relevant in a moment.

John works full-time but also runs a side hustle advising people on whether a used boat is worth buying. He’s built a solid reputation, and his clients seem happy with his advice.

While I don’t have John’s level of expertise, I’m passionate about this topic and have been seriously considering starting a business that focuses on marketing these services and finding clients. My idea is to handle the marketing and connect clients with experts like John, leaving the technical advice to them.

I brought up this idea to John yesterday for the first time, and he wasn’t happy. He said it felt like a betrayal and accused me of trying to create direct competition, which he thinks isn’t something a friend should do.

I’ll admit I might not have thought of this idea if John hadn’t started his side hustle first. But I genuinely don’t think it’s unfair. To me, this feels no different than two friends applying for similar jobs in the same field.

Some might suggest we partner up, and that’s a fair point. But I think we’re in different stages of life—he’s married with a 3-year-old, while I’m single and more willing to take risks.

Am I the asshole here?"
5,1jxqsks,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not inviting my dad’s partner to my micro “wedding” dinner, and for not reaching out to her first to explain why?","Using a throwaway to not connect this to my main.

My partner and I are getting married this summer, and we’ve decided to essentially elope. We’re going to have a private ceremony just the two of us during our honeymoon. Not only does this align very much with who we are, so no one in our life is very surprised by this, but we’re also doing it because: 1. our families live scattered across the world and a larger event would mean leaving a lot of people out, and 2. We want to avoid drama.

However, what we do want to do is get dressed up, take photos, and have a dinner together with our immediate families. So essentially, a micro non-wedding celebration. This is where the issues start.

So I told my parents I wanted to have this small event with just them, my partner, and my sister (not including their “new” partners). My parents went through a nasty divorce when I was in my teens, and for several reasons that I explained to them I wanted an intimate event just the five of us. My mom was fully supportive, saying she can understand why this would be so meaningful for me.

My dad understood too. But he wanted me to be the one to break the news to his partner (54F). I didn’t think I had to, because it’s not like I’m calling everyone single other family member who isn’t invited to explain this decision. But I said that if she’s upset she’s more than welcome to call me and we can talk about it. His partner is very sensitive, and we’ve clashed a lot over the years because I don’t think she’s ever been fully willing to understand the nuances of coming into a family after a divorce. Their relationship started shortly after the divorce, and she tried to parent both my sister and I (who were teens/pre-teens) from the get-go. But even though we’re not close, I’ve done my best to otherwise be welcoming and kind.

Well, now he’s told her and all hell has broken lose. She’s completely beside herself, and he wants me to mitigate the issue and reach out. I’ve reiterated that she’s free to call me - if she can’t possibly understand why this is about me and not her (and I can understand she’s disappointed, but so is, I assume, everyone else) then she should reach out to me.

AITA for not inviting her, and for not breaking the news to her, and for refusing to be the first person to reach out here to resolve this? I can kind of see my dad's point, who says I should be extra mindful of her since she is a sensitive person who has had a hard time accepting we're not very close and takes this personally. However, at the same time, I don't think I'm responsible for her feelings or for cleaning up this 'mess.' I also believe in the idea of “my wedding, my choice.”"
6,1jxqjp9,Asshole,WIBTAH if i don’t “match” with my family for pics,"a bit of backstory- the house i lived in consists of both my grandparents, my mother, & my little sister. my entire family is made up of narcissists and about two months ago i(17f) officially moved out against their wishes to live with my bf, & i had been staying with him for a year prior to that. i’ve never got along with any of them and never liked trying to do stuff “as a family” bc it always ends up in a fight. now they want to take family pictures.

the reason this is such a big deal to me is bc for one, im basically estranged to them- i only go there every two weeks or so to see my little sister & other than that i dont talk to them and they dont talk to me unless asking a favor. & im fine with it being that way but it fucks with me the way they still post on social media as if we’re all besties and always have been. 
i also do not “fit in” w them because i dress a bit more alternative per say, and they always want me to dress all girly and bright when that’s just not me at all. however for the pictures they are demanding that i match with them but they’re all dressing like they’re going to church and once again, that is not my style at all. i don’t feel confident or comfortable dressed how they’ve always wanted me to. today i went to try on some dresses for the pictures & i ended up leaving with some rock revival jeans and a black half button shirt with a white shirt layered under it, which is what i plan to wear for pictures. 

i already know i definitely seem like an ass and it’s gonna be a matter of “why can’t you just dress this way one time” but i honestly just don’t think it’s that important that we’re all coordinated, & quite honestly idgaf if we match or if i’m even in the pics at all. i’m just doing this to please them bc ever since i moved out it takes one time of me not being a pushover and they explode bc all they want is control over me and my life. and im just not trying to deal with all of their bs if i can prevent it, but i can tell you one thing- i will not be wearing a dress tomorrow.

so yeah there’s my storytime id love to hear other opinions on the situation bc im pretty nervous to show up in my daily attire tomorrow, even tho thats the way i feel most comfortable, bc i know it will somehow turn into an argument like everything else does."
7,1jxqbst,Not the A-hole,AITA friend keeps aking for heritage (jokingly),"So my best friend seems to have a midlifecrisis at 28. She thinks a lot about kids, I get that but she also talks about heritage and wills for about two weeks. Like that was all we talked about in two weeks.

Before she made jokes about me being her sugar mama, being godmother of her future kids and that they will be provided for, that I should put her in my will. I got the joke but it keeps on going and going... she tells me about laws if I do not have a will it will go to the state (which is not true) and so on and so forth...

I did not have a car for three weeks and she drove me to several appointments I had to get a new one and I thought it was.. you know, something a friend would do. As a ""thank you"" I offered her to invite her to get some burgerking or whatever food she wanted (so we had a reason to meet because that is kinda rare too) and she said she'd rather have some gas money.

Fine, I get it. It shows me again it is not about getting together, it always seems to be about money now. I ask her to go to the cinema - she got no money to go, ask her to go get icecream - she does not have money. I would need to offer to pay for her to get her to do something WITH me.

For christmas I bought inline-skates. asked her about six times if she wants to go with me to inlineskate. asked to go on a walk, even with her dog, it is all free and does not cost money but she never really replies...  
I am giving her options to do something together, even grocery shopping which we need to do anyways and I know she does it at the beginning of the month - nothing.  
Last she said was ""I don't care about your money!"" (but she also mentioned I should put in my will that it goes to her lil sister)

\--------

  
So today I send her a voicemessage saying I feel weird that it is always about money and that she keeps talking about giving her my money after I die (heritage). I told her that I am not thinking about a will and heritage right now and that's it but she kept talking about it. She got angry and now I told her I will not contact her for about a week so we can both cool off and then maybe get back together and talk.

  
I am not sure how to deal with it. Am I the asshole for telling her to shut up with her ""joke""?  I get that she is my best friend for years, we can talk about everything but this made me feel really negative about her.  
*I am currently looking to move away and she does not want me to but we don't even meet once a month so why would I? Why not let me move away and find new friends I can actually go out with?*

  
Thank you for reading and answering, it is a lot of text "
8,1jxq5xu,No A-holes here,WIBTA if I refuse to pay the rest of the money I owe them for a trampoline,"Me (34f) shared the cost of a trampoline with our two neighbors that have kids. This happened after I mentioned that I was going to get one for my kids and one mentioned we should split one for all the kids to save money, and I agreed because it seemed simple, I offered to put it on my land but they made the decided to put it between there and I didn't mind. We all put it together and I paid half of what I owe already. We all get along and have no issues with being honest with each other, our kids are all fine with each other as well. We have only had the trampoline for about a week, and I am already getting frustrated. 
So the issue I'm so unsure of how to proceed on happened last night. My son had his friend sleep over, and at one point many of the kids on the street were out and wanted to be on the trampoline, it got too crowded and I had my kids and their friend get off, but later I let my two kids and his friend go out with my husbands work flashlights to jump in the dark. Well they were outside for maybe 5 minutes, when my neighbor went outside and said they had to get off the trampoline ""as the owner of this property"", and wasnt very kind about it according to my son and his friend. She then called me and said not to be mad at her but she kicked them off because it's unsafe to be out of a trampoline at night. I kept quiet and said ok, and she asked to hangout and I declined nicely so we hung up. I am actually really mad about the situation and feel like she really over stepped. I don't appreciate anyone talking to my kids that way, we agreed to shared the trampoline, I helped pay for it, and I don't feel that my kids were really that unsafe (by the way I forgot to mention I was outside in the garage when they were out there). I feel like I don't want to pay anymore into the trampoline and just get my own, but I also just don't want to be petty. What would should I do? "
9,1jxpp8y,Not the A-hole,AITA for wanting my money back,"First ever reddit post. Never thought i'd end up here but i need some outside perspective. 
me (27, female) and 5 friends (all female, in their 20s) went on a trip together to paris. 
i am the planner friend, i found the airbnb, booked it, collected the funds from everyone etc. 
i love doing it, and dont expect anything in return.

unfortunately all of us became very sick on the trip, during different days, i was the last one whom it hit.
we were planning on flying back home monday, but the airport striked, so almost all flights got cancelled.
 mine and my friends Pepes (name changed) was the only one leaving. 
because the rest of our friend group could only leave on tuesday we were looking for a place to sleep.
 My friend Joni tried to book our airbnb for another night but i didn't work. I thought since i was the one who booked originally i would just ask the host if we could extend for one more night on sunday afternoon, as i was sick i went to bed right after.

 we were supposed to check out on monday at 11, so when i woke up at 9, and saw that he had responded to say that we would stay another night, i booked it. i tried to see if anyone was up yet, but everyone was asleep and i thought well we all need a place to stay anyway. i texted everyone that could extend and everyone was delighted. 
a few hours later my friend Joni and her friend Randy texted our group chat saying that i should have talked to everyone first before booking and that they did not want to pay for the extended night. i apologized and said that i understood that what i did was rushed. i told them if they did not want to stay at the airbnb that they could check out now, and find a different place to stay. that way they would not have to pay me. Mind you it was 50€ p.P so finding a cheaper place in paris is impossible. they decided to stay in the airbnb since it was easier for everyone.

 Randy said that her airline might cover the costs of the extra night anyway. She submitted everything but they declined. When i asked everyone to pay their share now, Joni and Randy refuse to pay or at least don't want to pay the full amount.

 They say i should have talked to them before booking, mind you i had a fever of 40 but i digress. I told them that they had the opportunity to leave and not have to pay, but they chose to stay and therefor need to pay me. i can't just afford to spent 250€ a night all on my own.

 maybe context is important but i'm not very wealthy, i'm on benefits and struggle a lot to get by, this vacation was a real treat to me. all over the other attendees are very well of, 50€ is not a lot to them. Am i the asshole here? i feel like it is totally reasonable to expect them to pay their share. 


edit: for more context, their reasoning as to why they don't want to pay is that they came up with a different plan while i was asleep. they were planning on going to a hotel, which the airline would have covered probably. the reason the airline doesn't want to cover the airbnb is because Randy forgot to add her name to the airbnb group, so her name wasn't on the invoice, which i did not know.

10,1jxpp1p,Asshole,AITA for telling my girlfriend the truth even though it made her upset?,"It’s my freakin’ birthday. You’d think I’d get a little peace, right? Instead, I get hit with “your words are offensive” and “foul play” because I had the nerve to talk about my aspirations and who I’m tryin’ to become. I didn’t insult her, I didn’t yell—I just spoke honestly. And that’s apparently a crime now.

She says I’m supposed to lie down and keep quiet just ‘cause it ruffled her feathers. I told her, “Sorry for ya, but I thought hard about this before I said anything.” If my words offended her, then maybe they needed to. Not everything in life’s meant to be sugarcoated. John the freakin’ Baptist called people snakes and he didn’t lose sleep over it. I ain’t sayin’ she’s a snake—but I’m not gonna act like I’m servin’ dessert when I’m just speakin’ truth.

Am I bein’ an asshole? Yeah, probably. But I’m an honest one. And guess what? If she wants someone to blow smoke and spoon-feed her pleasantries, there’s no shortage of sycophants out there. I’m just not on the dessert menu.

So yeah, AITA for being real instead of nice?"
11,1jxpoob,Asshole,AITA for making my daughter wear a dress to a party,"I have a daughter 15f who usually prefers dressing casual and generally doesn't like wearing skirts and dresses. I don't really have a problem with this usually as long as it's appropriate.

Recently my daughter wanted to go to her best freinds sweet 16. I had no problem with this obviously I thought she already picked out something nice to dress in. But when she was about to go she was in literal sweatpants with a t shirt. 

I don't have a problem with her wearing that normally but not to a birthday party especially her best freinds sweet 16 party. She said it's what she liked wearing but I said no way she was not attending the party in that.

She has a nice blur drees a cousin gifted her a few months ago she never wore it through. I asked her to put it on because it would look good on her and she could match with her freind.

She refused for a minute until I told her if she didn't wear it just this once I'd start making her dress more feminine from now on. She ultimately agreed and wore the dress and had a lot of fun at the party. Apparently her freind really liked the dress too.

But my husband thinks I went too far so AITA?"
12,1jxpizd,Not the A-hole,AITA for Being Disappointed My Family Wouldn't Help Me When Very Ill,\*
13,1jxp5hk,No A-holes here,AITA for telling my parents I won’t be coming home unless they let me sleep in the same bed as my bf?,"Hello all, for context, I (19F) and my bf (20M) have been together for 5, almost 6 years. I moved away for college about a year ago and live on campus with 5 other roommates in an apartment style dorm. 

My bf comes to visit me at college every month or so, and we share a bed while he is here. My roommate’s don’t care and it is considered a normal thing considering he’s not a rando and we are in a long term, healthy relationship. 

One time, when I went home, my bf accidentally (genuinely) fell asleep in my bed, no funny business. My parents woke up earlier than we did, and were upset that he slept in the same bed as I did. They say it makes them uncomfortable regardless of how long we have been together and that they consider it disrespectful. They went as far as getting his parents involved, who personally don’t care if we share a bed because they say we are adults. However, they don’t allow us to share a bed because my parents don’t approve and they don’t want to rock the boat. 

Upon returning back to college, I have made it a point to not go back home for quite some time and instead he comes to visit me more often. My mom asked me why I haven’t been home and I told her it was because I wanted to sleep in the same bed as my bf, and that no one has a problem with us sleeping in the same bed at college, so I might as well stay there. She got upset saying I was being ridiculous and I ended up telling her I would only come home if they “gave up on their ridiculous rule and let him sleep in my bed”. She has yet to cave. While my opinion remains the same, I am worried that maybe I was a little petty and unjustified, AITA? 

Extra Info:
* both of our families know we plan to get married in the next several years
* when he doesn’t sleep in my bed, he is either on the living room sofa, or he drives home at 1-2am
* my parents claim that the reason is that we are not married, but they have no problem with (when my cousins stay with us) my cousins sleeping in the same bed as their gf’s. 

***Final Edit: Lots of questions were asked such as who pays for college and things of that sort. 
* I am on an academic scholarship which covers tuition, i pay for everything on my own via my job as a server. i work on the weekends while in school and during the summer when i go home, i work both during the week and every weekend to support myself better during the school year. 
* yes my cousins are male and they have been allowed to sleep in the same bed as their gf’s under the same roof as my parents (and grandparents) since they were 17/18. 

Final remarks: Thank you all for your input (except for those who were just kinda hateful for no reason)! i made this post originally because i know i tend to make mountains out of molehills sometimes and i was afraid this was one of those times. after reading all of the comments i called my mother and apologized for being dramatic. we are on great terms once again thank to you all.

14,1jxova8,Not the A-hole,AITA for my the animosity I have towards my soon to be MIL?,"My boyfriend (27) and I (25F) have been dating for 3 years. I have been the confidant to his family's drama which includes his mother who is very sweet but seems to not be able to keep a steady job, home, or relationships, even her 3 other kids have completely shut her out recently.  He wouldn't see her often, but she would call at any time, typically after drinks and always very emotional, hysterical or angry. It seems like every phone call to my boyfriend would turn into a “they’re out to get me” call that involved conspiracies and It seems she’s taking zero accountability for why these things happened. At first, he would get very infuriated on her behalf to whoever she called to complain about, and when I say infuriated, I mean fist balling up, huffing and puffing. As time went on,I was trying to teach him to relax a little more and not be so angry and hostile towards the rest of his family and he seemed to appreciate it. He was able to reconnect with his father and siblings and even considered making peace with his stepfather who he blames for all the things that were happening to his mom. 

Recently, she was doing better, even started renting a house with her daughter who she had also reconciled with until we learned that her daughter had moved out with no notice and his mom was left with a rent bill she could not pay. Because of this, she decided to pack her car and move several dates away to stay with us. It came as quite a shock to me since I wasn’t a big part of the decision making. It was more like I overheard it on speaker phone when she said she'd be down here in less than a week. I was happily willing to help her get back on her feet and have something stable for her for once but I didn't realize that this situation would bring up feelings that I'm not used to.The annoyance started with things being slightly rearranged in my home, new decor was added, and my kitchen cabinets, pantry and fridge can't seem to get put back the way I left it. On top of that, my boyfriend are young and have no kids so we like to spend our money on nice things, hobbies and good groceries, We have the comfortability and blessed option to live the way that we want to but his mom seems to judge us for it and make snide remarks about how we should be better about that and how she knows what real struggle is. We have as well and I dont think it's just of her to decide that I haven't been through “enough pain and struggle.” The thing that has me feeling the most uncomfortable is that she is staying in my boyfriend's game room that he will STILL stay in until 1AM playing while shein there as well. I'm not sure why this makes me uncomfortable. I hate these feelings but I've just been finding myself getting more and more angry and irritated when I'm home. I am hoping that we are able to get her job and on her way to her own apartment soon but until then, am I being the asshole for feeling so much unwarranted animosity and anger towards this his mom?

15,1jxoapl,Not the A-hole,AITA for not going with the hair stylist my cousin chose,"Heyy guys so I’m 19 F and my cousin is 27F so here’s the situation my cousin offered to pay for my hair and my hair appointment as a favor since I will be taking care of her mom while she’s on vacation. Okay so now that you now that my cousin sends me a stylist and told me pick which one I wanted this stylist is a professional but I’m so used to my older cousin who does my hair doing the style that I wanted to get and I told my cousin B that I wanted to go with my cousin A who always does my hair she said no because my cousin is unprofessional but I told her it’s not about professionalism it’s truly just about my comfort and who I want in my hair. My cousin got upset and then said that she will not be paying for my hair or the installation because she rather I go to a professional. But the thing is my cousin A can literally slay some hair she just didn’t choose that route she’s a ABA. But not the point my cousin called me ungrateful and I did try to explain hey I’m not trying to be ungrateful just that’s my preference and that’s what I’m comfortable with but some how I still for like a ass hole because am I being ungrateful? I know lots of people would kill to get the hair done by a professional but just not me I like that fact I can go somewhere where I’m comfortable and familiar with. Oh lemme make something clear before I forget she’s still paying me for my services but the hair/ installation was going to be tooken out of my full pay. 

Edit: she said she will no longer be needing my services. I truly believe she no longer wants me to work for her because my cousin is the type of person if you disagree with her she will literally go off on you it’s like your not allowed to have your opinion if she don’t agree."
16,1jxo4w5,Asshole,"AITA for wanting my girlfriend to move her dog to a different room at night, even though it’s been affecting my sleep?","My girlfriend (32F) and I (31M) recently moved in together. We’ve been dating for about a year, and she’s amazing in so many ways. But ever since we moved in, I’ve been struggling to sleep due to her dog’s snoring. The dog sleeps in our room, right next to the bed, and snores loud enough to keep me up even with a white noise machine right next to my head.

I’ve brought it up to her a few times—not dramatically, but just saying that I’m having trouble sleeping and wondering if there’s a way we could try having the dog sleep in a different room. Her answer has basically been no. She has a very strong bond with the dog (8 years old), and she says she doesn’t feel right making the dog sleep somewhere else. 

To be fair, I’ve made a few changes myself, and she has been very accommodating: we keep the room colder for me, we run white noise (albeit because of the dog), and obviously she’s sharing her space with someone else. I get that this is a big adjustment for both of us. But I can’t shake the feeling that my needs are equally important (or less) than her dog’s. For context, I have a cat that sometimes sleeps with us, and I communicated that if needed, I’m more than happy to keep him shut out of the room at night (she’s allergic).

I said that if the roles were reversed, I’d prioritize her sleep over my pet. She said that wasn’t a fair comparison, implying I didn’t understand the depth of her relationship with her dog, or that my relationship with my cat paled in comparison.

I’m not asking her to get rid of the dog. I just want to be able to sleep, and to feel like my needs matter more than the needs of a dog. Much like I believe her needs matter more than the needs of my cat.

So… AITA?

EDIT: Very early on, she told me sleeping in the same bed was non-negotiable. So for everyone suggesting sleeping in a different room, that’s been shut down. 

EDIT 2: Ordered earplugs."
17,1jxnz8f,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting my friend kicked out of the Minecraft movie for being disruptive?,"I (22 M) went to see the new Minecraft movie with about 6 of my friends (22, all male).

First, let me add some context. As some of you may know, the Minecraft movie has been attracting a certain kind of “fratty” crowd to some of its showings. The infamous “chicken jockey” scene has been invoking these hooligans to be very disruptive to the point of ruining the movie experience. I am all for lighthearted fun, but some of the antics I’ve seen in videos have been downright heinous.

Me and most of my friends all had a similar mindset, and all agreed to not do anything ridiculous during our showing of the movie. However, one of our friends obviously did not get the memo. Now, granted, he (like the rest of us) had had a couple beers beforehand, so we were all feeling a little loose. But, right from the getgo, he was hooting and hollering, and making a big ruckus. And, mind you, almost no one else was matching his energy. Some of the crowd found it funny, while others, let’s just say, did not.

This came to a head at the “chicken jockey” scene. Instead of screaming “chicken jockey”, he just screamed at the top of his lungs in a high pitched manner, with someone in the audience responding with a “Shut up!”. This was it for me. I got up acting like I was going to use the bathroom, but went straight to the front desk and reported his behavior. I returned to my seat, and a moment later he was kicked out of the theater.

It somehow got back to him that I was the one who reported it, and now he’s angry with me, saying he was just joking around and was humiliated from being kicked from the theater. Some of my other friends also believe I went a step too far by kicking him out, and should have talked to him directly instead of going to the front desk. What do you all think?"
18,1jxnsr6,Not the A-hole,AITA if boyfriend is trying to control my life and I don't want to hear none about it?,"Hi I'm a 20f and my boyfriend 22m, the situation started a month ago. I live in Canada so weed is legal but my boyfriend recently quit smoking cannabis and try to brainwash me into quitting.

 I know what you think weed is bad, but I feel good with it and have no problem dealing with my life. I work 40h/week in a factory, it's paying well and I save money on the side to pay my debt's and being able to give myself a little treat sometimes in the month. I pay a rent at my dad house, pay for my food, pay for my cats foods and other essential, I do my chores after my job, gives time to my boyfriend, my dad and my cat. Tbh, I have a lot of responsibility. 

My boyfriend is unemployed (it's been almost 3 years), only does his room and smoke vape and cigarettes all day playing with his video games, and as I said recently quit smoking weed. I'm glad for him but recently he's harassing me with it and I can't live with someone who want to control me and can't even think for himself. He is now mad because I don't want his advice because I'm not feeling mad about my weed consumption. 
AITA?"
19,1jxnl8r,Not the A-hole,AITA for bailing on going to the movies with my sister and her friends?,"I (21F) and my half sister (28F) are planning on seeing a movie at the theater tonight. I’m currently staying at her new apartment this weekend for the two of us to hang out. I don’t get to see her too often since I live in the next state over from her. She asked me a few days ago if I wanted to see a movie, which I said yes to.

My sister is at a friend’s birthday party right now while I’m staying at her apartment. It’s been nice to enjoy the peace and quiet even when I’m by myself relaxing, and playing video games. My sister invited me to the party before I arrived to her apartment but I declined. I didn’t tell her this but I’m just not interested in going somewhere where I don’t know most of her friends and I’m just the odd one out. I know I would just be extremely uncomfortable and awkward.

Anyway, the plan is that after her friend’s party, we’re going to meet each other at the movie theater. I’m not crazy about the idea of having to walk 15 minutes to get to the subway and then take a 20 minute subway ride by myself but it’s still manageable so I agreed to the plan. 

Yesterday she told me that one of her friends is also going to the movies with us. I wouldn’t say it annoyed me but I was looking forward to just seeing the movie with my sister. But it’s still fine. I know this friend really well and like her so it’s cool. But this morning, my sister told me that another one of her friends is going who I don’t know well at all. This annoys me because one, she didn’t even ask me if it was okay that these people are going, she just made an announcement that they are. I figured it was just going to be the two of us from the start. I also have bad social anxiety which is why I didn’t want to go to her friend’s party in the first place. Now I’m really not looking forward to going to the movies because the dynamic changes completely and I feel like my sister thinks it’s not good enough to just see a movie with me so she has to invite other people to go. Also, the whole point of me coming to her at her apartment is so I can hang out with HER. I didn’t come for any other reason. And if she’s going to see her friends at the party, I don’t understand why she also has to invite them to the movie that same day. Now I’m weighing either telling her that I don’t feel good or that I’m too comfortable or tired to leave the apartment to meet up with them.

I don’t mean any disrespect to her or her friends. I want them to have a good time at the movies. I just know that I’m not going to have a good time myself so I’m dreading going. The plan was to also have dinner before the movie so there’s the added stress of that social intersection with her two friends that are going, as well. She already paid for my ticket online but I’m sure she can get refunded. So WIBTA if I bail on going?

UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who replied. It motivated me to face my anxiety and go to the movies. It ended up being okay. I’m still not thrilled with my sister’s actions but I’m glad I went. "
20,1jxmrqq,Asshole,AITA for scaring people at the beach by yelling “shark”?,"Today has been a really tough day as what was supposed to be a fun prank turned into something a lot bigger. We arrived in Florida on friday and yesterday was our first full day. The beach we were at was pretty busy and there were lots of people hanging out in the water. My buddies and I had had a bit to drink and wanted to have a laugh by pulling an innocent prank. The four of us started screaming “SHARK!! SHARK!” While running out of the water as fast as we can. We didn’t even think most people would notice but within 30 seconds almost everyone in our sight started running out of the water, screaming as well. As we watched everyone from little kids to older folk get out of the water we quickly realized what a big mistake we made. Children crying to their parents. There were a few minutes of confusion and people looking out into the water for the said shark when we decided it was best to pack up and get out of there as quick as we could. We ended up walking to a second location to wait for an uber, no idea what happened at the beach after that. We meant it as a joke but feel a bit bad as literally everyone we could see in the water ran out out screaming."
21,1jxm2p4,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I blocked access to a Google Sheet with lab data from my group members who haven't done their part of the work for a month?,"While the project/report isn't necessarily a group project, we had agreed to share data from a lab we did as long as I organized the data better and then they'd made the graphs/tables needed. It's been over a month since then and no edits have been made since I organized our data despite the report being due tomorrow. Yeah it was stupid of me to trust someone else to help with something that wasn't really a group project but it was something we agreed on doing and as of yesterday they still claim they will do the work.

I'm thinking of blocking them from having access to the organized version of our data and giving them the excel sheet we typed up during lab (since we did do that part together at least). WIBTA for that? Seems only fair at this point since I did my agreed upon part of the work but they never did this whole time."
22,1jxleya,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling my mom why my dad doesn't want to talk to her.,"I'm 27f, my mom is 53, dad is 60. My mom and dad have been split up for almost 2 years now, still working through getting divorced. My dad isn't talking to her though, he has tried but majority of the time she is just toxic and mean to him. She's blocked since October, and he's using 3rd parties to communicate and to give papers/items. I know my dad isn't lying, I've dealt with mean mom many times, having a calm, cool discussion with her can be pretty difficult. 

She always acts oblivious and clueless of why she is blocked, whenever the topic of my dad comes up she says ""I just don't understand why we can't talk like adults"". Her being blocked by him shouldn't be my issue, but she vents to me about it as if it is and it feels so awkward. I never do participate in talking about it, but I can't never even mention my dad without her pouting about him not wanting to talk to her. She asks about him often, but I always keep it vague because I know if I'm too honest she will get mad. 

My dad is getting ready to sell the house, and my mom really wants to help. She has been asking more about my dad, asking why he doesn't want to talk to her, I know the answer, but I just tell her that he just doesn't want to talk. I know if I tell her that he thinks she is toxic and mean... I don't think it's the children's responsibility to send that message. But she keeps asking questions, wondering if I should just be honest... Am I the asshole?"
23,1jxkm21,Not the A-hole,AITA for wanting my husband to choose our kids over his mom for Easter,"My husband booked a course for the Friday +Saturday of Easter weekend without realizing his mother’s birthday fell on Easter Sunday. 
Fast forward to March I realized the dates all lining up and was trying to find a solution for him to do his two day course, fit in an Easter dinner, a birthday dinner, and when the Easter bunny comes for our two young kids (3&5) My in-laws live 2.5hrs away, and there is no way I can let my kids do a chocolate egg hunt, have chocolate for breakfast and put them in the car for almost three hours wired for us to visit his mom on Sunday on her birthday/ Easter. 
I suggested we will do my family’s dinner on Saturday, then Sunday do easter morning for the kids and invite his family to come to us for brunch so my kids naps and sugar crashing can be delt with accordingly. He agreed on the plan , then last week he tells me he ‘forgot’ to invite his family here for Sunday and now his mom is expecting us there Sunday. I said well then we have to do Easter morning with the kids on Saturday then but you have your course, don’t you want to be here for that experience with the kids? and he said yes so he will cancel the course and since it’s enough notice will get refunded the cost. 
Now a week before Easter being today I’m on the computer with his emails open and I see that he just submitted the confirmation that he will be attending the course next weekend. 
So I know come Thursday he’s going to lie and say he couldn’t get his money back ect. Knowing how this is all going to go ( we have been together for 18 years ) I’m ready to tell him that the kids and I will not be going to his parents house on Sunday and we can visit the weekend after when we have less things going on. AITAH ? 

Edit to add- My mother in law knows about the course he is on Friday and Saturday and knows the only day we have together as a family is Sunday but still expects us there. Didn’t ask what our plans were and if we would be able to come, just said Easter and my birthday dinner is at 4 on Sunday see you guys then. "
24,1jxjpig,Everyone Sucks,AITA for insulting (24F)  a friend (28M) after an argument?,"
I (24F) moved back home two months ago after living abroad for years. A friend (28M) invited me to his brother’s birthday party. This friend often acts like he’s always right, and is very charismatic 

At the party, I saw a guy I didn’t like. While my friend and I were eating outside, I casually mentioned that I didn’t like this guy. I didn’t say this to complain or ask my friend to do anything; I just wanted to start a conversation because I trust him and we’ve known each other for years.
My friend responded condescendingly, saying I was always involved in ""teen drama."" I asked him what drama he was talking about, esp since I had just returned from abroad. I explained that I was only talking about this guy. Btw my friend didn’t even know him.

Then, my friend brought up an old conversation from when we last saw each other 2 months back where I mentioned being ghosted by a guy after we hooked up. I felt comfortable sharing this with him because we’ve been friends for years. My friend then suggested that complaining about being ghosted was immature and “teen drama.” I disagreed and told him that ghosting happens at all ages. I also told him I felt he was being condescending 

My friend started making generalizations about women not handling rejection well, claiming that’s why some men ghost. I told him it’s not just about women, and that a lot of men are acting weird. He got upset, raised his voice, said that women were no saints. I called him out on raising his voice at me, then he said that whenever I raise my voice, I’m emphasizing a point, but when he does it, he’s a jerk. I asked him when I’d ever raised my voice at him. The conversation turned into him lecturing me, arguing that my feelings were wrong, and condescendingly debating every point I made. He then said that friends are supposed to tell each other the truth and that I should just deal with it. I told him that friends should also respect it when a friend tells them something hurts.

He claimed my conversations with him often focused on men I had problems with, but that wasn’t true. We talk about many things, and he himself discussed his own failed relationships with women. Also, the conversations are usually him talking at me.

Eventually, I told him I wanted to leave, and he didn’t seem to care. I left the party, and my cousin picked me up. Later that night, I texted him to explain how his behavior made me feel and called him a jerk (I know I shouldn’t have). He responded with, “Okay, that’s fine bye.

A few days ago, this friend also told me that I was “stupid sometimes” but “very intelligent” other times. He said this after I asked him a question to clarify something he was saying. I got upset, and he responded that he wouldn’t apologize because he didn’t want to deal with my “tantrums.”

Now, I feel conflicted. I know I shouldn’t have insulted him via text, and maybe I made this more serious than it was. So, AITA?
"
25,1jxjoc2,Not the A-hole,AITA for ditching my family on my birthday?,"long story short. 
I’m turning 25. 

Every time my family members have had a birthday, the person whose birthday it is gets to choose dinner and we all come along. Even my 6 y.o niece got to pick- which is fine. It’s their day. 

I’ve always participated and gotten them gifts they’ve mentioned wanting. I don’t really feel particularly close to any of them for many reasons, but figured I’d at least try on my part. I’ve always gone over budget (concert tickets, expensive collectibles, etc) and it’s always been received well.

I already do a lot of favors for them I don’t necessarily feel like. Watching their houses when they’re gone, taking care of their pets, listening to their problems and helping with tech or whatever.  

I don’t exactly pick pennies. I don’t really care since I live alone and I’m paid decently. It’s not about that- but when my day comes around, they’ve managed to scrounge together a bottle of hair oil and a gift card, and my parents announced they’d already bought groceries for dinner without asking me. 

I got extremely upset and asked my mom why everyone else gets to pick and I don’t, and she just says it was my dad’s choice, who then says my sister said I “had no plans,” which is a lie. They keep tossing the ball to each other and shrugging it off. My mom gets pissed and says she already blew 100$ on groceries - which I didn’t ask for, to make something they know I don’t like. 

She then gets cross with me and says if it’s not good enough, I can just pay for everyone to go somewhere else. That’s never been part of the tradition before. We’ve always paid for our own meals, except when someone offers to host and make dinner. It’s worth noting that last year they didn’t bother coming because they “didn’t feel like going” due to “jet lag”… after flying 2 hours.

Ironically, the only one who put any thought or care was my 6 y.o niece who painted a flower as well as you’d expect a 6 year old to in my favorite color. It’s obviously going up on the wall at home. I ended up ditching them and getting McDonald’s with her alone.

Now they’re all telling me I’m selfish and ungrateful. My mom wants me to pay back for her groceries. I’m kind of considering just ghosting them for a while. 

AITA?"
26,1jxh3kc,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my girlfriend to take the public transport?,"She is having her themed dinner and dance, and I offered to drive her to the location in town. I told her I will pick her up at 5.30pm because any later and I will be stuck in the peak hour traffic jam on the way back home, and she should take the public transport instead if she wants to leave later. The public transport takes at most 30 minutes with about 5 to 10 minutes of walking.

Come 5:20pm, she said that she needed more time for make up and preparation, and she was finally ready at around 5.40pm. I told her to take the public transport instead and she was upset.


Girlfriend is habitually late and she said that being a few minutes late is no big deal and as a couple I should demonstrate my love for her by waiting, even if I have to wait in the traffic jam for an hour on the way home after dropping her off, when the journey is usually about 20 minutes. She had to take off some dress items and put them back on at the D&D because it is embarrassing for her on the public transport. AITAH?"
27,1jxfpqe,Asshole,AITA for telling my boyfriend it’s weird that he would rather stay at a party than drive us back home,"My boyfriend (26m) and I (25f) live together in the city and were planning on going out to the suburbs with 2 of our friends for another friends bday party. It’s about an hour - hour fifteen minutes of a drive for us. The plan was for me to drive there and for him to drive back since we share a car, and that way he can drink in the beginning of the night, and I could drink later on in the evening. We ended up staying  pretty late in the suburbs (till around 3 AM) and didn’t get home till 4:30 AM. On the drive home, he mentioned how he wished he could have stayed there longer since he was meeting people and having a good time, but since me and my other friend from the city were tired, he had to leave since he was driving. I told him that I was pretty sure the host and his girlfriend were tired so they probably wouldn’t have wanted us to stay super late, but he said that wasn’t true because I guess the host asked us to stay longer when we decided to go (which I thought was just a formality but I guess I don’t know for sure) during the conversation he said he wished I could have driven home and he could have stayed, spent the night (literally on the floor, because the host and his girlfriend were going to be in the one bedroom, and someone else was already planning on taking  the couch) and took the train back in the morning. I thought this was absurd because he was already tired when driving home, so really how much later would he really have been awake at the hosts house anyway? So I told him that would be so weird if he stayed and I left, especially so late at night. I’m trying to pinpoint exactly why I felt upset by him saying this, but I guess I just feel like since we’re a couple, and we made a plan to come home to our house  together and for him to drive, I feel upset that he would have been ok with me just driving back in the middle of the night all the way back to the city. Of course this is a hypothetical situation, but it still made me feel upset. He said that it would be selfish of me to feel that way because if I was having a good time somewhere, he wouldn’t force me to go home with him just because he wanted to go home, and he wouldn’t mind going home himself. While I agree with that if we were just visiting some friends in the city, i feel like if the roles where reversed and we were in the suburbs and it was such a long drive home in the middle of the night, I would obviously go home with him if he was tired even if I wanted to stay. The whole situation just made me feel like he didn’t care about me, or my wellbeing / safety . Idk, am i being sensitive and overthinking this ? AITA? "
28,1jxf78q,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I didn’t go to my brother’s destination wedding?,"My (30F) brother (27M) has announced that him and his fiancé are planning to get married in Hawaii next year. Where we currently live, flights at the moment are about $2.5K return. My husband (30M) and I have 2 children, which are also invited, so we would be looking at close to 10k just for flights alone. 

We have a pretty solid income, however, with the cost of living we are (comfortably) just getting by. On top of flights, we are also considering costs such as passports, spending money, pet boarding, covering home expenses while away (rent, bills, etc) if we were to attend. To top things off our current lease is due to end just after chrissy so we are currently saving to make the moving process less overwhelming. 

When I tried to talk to my brother about this his response was “you only need to save $200 a week to get flights”.  My partner is not worried because my brother and his fiancé had a pretty public (family group chat) and nasty fight the other week when the fiancé had spent her car registration money on flights interstate to visit our mum. So my partner believes they will change their mind. 

I don’t know what to do or how to even begin potentially saving for this wedding. If we all go it will practically send us broke. If only I go, I will be berated about why I didn’t bring the children; I also don’t want to be away from my family that long. If I don’t go at all, I’ll never hear the end of it. 

Am I being unreasonable? "
29,1jxe4bm,No A-holes here,AITA for disagreeing that I shouldn't wear shorts because a girl finds me wearing them uncomfortable?,"Hi all,

I am someone who always has been wearing shorts my whole life. I've always worn shorts every weather, going gym, out, training, anything.

So today my cousin messaged me and told me not to wear shorts tomorrow (we are all meeting up at her place) and I asked why. He told me his girlfriend finds it uncomfortable that I wear shorts. I don't mind not wearing shorts as its her house at the end of the day.

I ended up messaging her asking to better understand her. She told me she ""personally has felt uncomfortable"" when I have worn shorts because of the positions I sit in. She said it shows my thighs and a bit more higher up. Which I was like what the heck, my shorts go up to my knees but okay. She didn't know how to tell me so told my cousin to tell me. She said she wanted to tell me from her perspective but also said she's not looking there directly but when seen by accident she's had to look away - WHAT THE HECK DOES THIS MEAN? my shorts go up to my knees literally.

I have worn shorts in front of her SEVERAL times, I literally wear shorts all the time. I just found it so weird.

So I spoke to one of my other cousins - he said that if a girl said me wearing shorts makes her uncomfortable I need to ""firm"" it and stop wearing shorts. I was like wtf?! He said I'm not being a man and if I made someone uncomfortable I need to compromise. I said that is this not similar when a guy tells a girl not to wear like a crop top for example and he ended up saying they are completely different with crop tops being normalised, for girls to show guys like it, its natural, etc. He told me to say sorry I made her uncomfortable and all.

He was saying that I am not being a man and if I don't care that I made a girl uncomfortable and not willing to change then he doesn't know what to say - I was honestly like so baffled as he just kept saying that I need to change and stop wearing shorts, just deal with it and stuff and say sorry.

What do you all think? AITA for completely disagreeing? I am happy to not wear shorts as its her house end of the day. But telling me not to wear shorts cos you are uncomfortable is crazy no? Why do I need to change what I wear to accommodate someone else? Am I being the asshole and arrogant here?

Edit:

Hi all - Thanks for the responses! Quite an eye-opener.

To clarify couple things:

\- Yes I do wear underwear underneath - no way on earth that I never don't.

\- A lot of people are calling me the asshole because they think I am showing my junk purposely - absolutely not. No way on hell. No. That is disgusting and no.

\- Lastly, majority of the comments are saying my genitals may have been showing because of the positions I sit in. HOWEVER why I am confused is I have worn those shorts several times in front of my friends and family, sitting on the coach, swing, grass, floor, etc. If my genitals had ever shown - I would be told 100%. I would also 100% know too because even when sitting in any position, I make sure to adjust my shorts.

My family would 100% tell me that they can see. I have had this shorts for time and worn them SEVERAL DOZENS of times. No my genitals are not showing AT ALL. I wear underwear under too.

In the case that I am wrong - I have worn this shorts for timeeee. No one has ever told me anything. Just to experiment I have worn that short and sat on my chair across the mirror to see. Even when trying it shows NOWHERE near my genital area. If anything the max it shows is my upper quads.

Also, recently we all met up and were chilling. There we so many of us and I wore that shorts and sat on the sofa - HOWEVER no one even said anything and I 100% would have been told. The girls would have mentioned it too 100% but have not even. I asked one of my friends if they have ever seen anything or the girls and he literally said no they haven't mentioned anything at all. Also he has sat across me many times and would 1000% tell me literally.

\- I have asked my friend literally and he has said no like I mentioned. All I was told is - Because I have made her uncomfortable, I shouldn't wear shorts. That is all. I have not been told by my cousins that I have ever exposed myself. It is literally just 1 person - the girl saying it.

This is why I thought it was weird.

But everyone thank you very much for your responses. Will be more mindful when I sit."
30,1jxdqtj,Not enough info,AITA being angry because my girlfriend's mother doesn't want to treat the cat for fleas,"My girlfriend (25F) and I have been together for almost two years, and we regularly argue about her mother's behavior. This discussion has been coming up since last summer: My girlfriend's cat, which lives at her mother's, has fleas.

And I don't understand how this situation is still happening. The cat has had fleas for almost a year, and it's a delicate situation because her mother is disabled and economically disadvantaged, so she can't do much during the day, and taking care of the cat takes up a lot of her energy.

However, she's already implied that she wants to get rid of the cat and is therefore being very passive, as if the situation isn't a problem. My girlfriend tells me she's tried various solutions, but because of her inaction and her passive attitude, the situation has worsened, and he caught tapeworm from eating flea eggs.

Everyone is taking pictures of him, making videos, giving him hugs, and sweet nothings, as if everyone is ignoring this situation. It's driving me completely crazy. What's more, my girlfriend's sister, who has money saved up and lives with her mother, isn't funding any treatment and isn't trying to improve the situation.

We're going to be spending three weeks at her parents' house soon, and I said yesterday, ""Your cat has had fleas for almost a year, and we're the ones doing the research, buying the treatment, and having to take care of it when we arrive. I think it's crazy to be so incapable, it's driving me crazy."" To which she replied, ""You can't blame my mother; there are a thousand reasons why he has fleas."" I stopped the conversation because I knew she wouldn't get anywhere. I don't understand why she's trying so hard to defend her mother, to defend this situation when she has such a bad relationship with her.

Tldr: My girlfriend's mother doesn't want to treat the cat's fleas, and it's our responsibility to do so if we don't want to live in a flea-infested place.

Am I the asshole ?"
31,1jxcp4t,Everyone Sucks,AITA for fucking with my co workers car?,"So, I work at Applebee’s as a server. It was pretty slow one night, and we were near closing. My coworker decided to mess with me and put a bunch of “to-go” stickers on my back. The stickers are about the size of a cup coaster, and he put like 19 of them on me. Yes, I’m that oblivious.

Anyway, when it was my turn to clean the restrooms, I thought it would be funny to get 20 of those same stickers and put them all over his front windshield. I didn’t think it would be dangerous or anything—just something to mildly annoy him.

After my boss sent me home, around half an hour after midnight, I got a call from my coworker. He didn’t sound like he wanted to kill me, but he was definitely upset. Long story short, he said I crossed a line. As he’s telling me this over the phone, I’m already driving back because I genuinely felt like an asshole.

When I got there, I saw him walking to his car and told him I was truly sorry. I explained that I honestly thought it was just a funny prank. I tried to give him $70, but he only took $50, saying he could tell I actually meant the apology.

I’m working the same shift with him later this week, so I plan to give him another $50 and a little sticker removal kit I found on Amazon. He said he was mostly upset because he was worried about scratching his windshield—but honestly, I don’t even know if that could really happen."
32,1jxbibg,Asshole,AITA for leaving my partner to suffer with a migraine and vomiting all day/night,"My partner recently came down with a migraine and was bed-bound and had 12 + hours of vomiting. They were not able to eat or drink anything or take  painkillers. I was working all day so didnt really keep track of what was going on with them. I also had a work event that night. When I got home after work, I asked my partner if they wanted me to cancel the event and they said no. Before I left, they did ask me to call the Dr to make an emergency appointment for the next day. The dr was on loudspeaker and expressed concern and said they wanted my partner to come in that evening because of the vomiting and dehydration. It was clear my partner was unsafe to drive but an appointment was made the next morning. I went to my event and didn't think anything about it. I got back about about 8 hours later. My partner is now upset upset because I didnt check in or contact them to see if they were ok. I don't think I needed to because they hadn't communicated that they wanted me to check in - so it's kinda on them. AITA"
33,1jxbgj8,Asshole,AITA for backing out last minute from another group's project help because we felt shy and unsure?,"Our class was divided into three groups for a group project. Let's call them Group 1 (us), Group 2, and Group 3. This issue only involves us and Group 2. Group 3 isn’t part of the conflict.
While we were discussing plans for our project, we were hanging out with friends from Group 2. Some of them were around during our group meeting, just sitting in. At one point, we brought up a need for a location for a part of our project. Some members from Group 2 casually suggested we could use theirs.
We were shy about it, so we kept double-checking if they were really okay with it. We never gave a solid ""yes"" to joining them we were always unsure and polite, not committing. 

Aside from the location, there were also talks of both groups helping each other with certain project parts, but again, nothing official.
Around 4 days before the event, they mentioned that the location might not be confirmed and was still uncertain. So as a backup plan, our group started looking for other possible locations just in case.
During this time, Group 2 kept asking us if we were still pushing through with the plan. It kind of made us forget the original idea of mutual help between groups because we thought the location and the help were still up in the air. We also thought we still had the choice to say no.

Two days before the shoot, we decided to back out. We felt that each group should be independent when it comes to responsibilities, and we were also still feeling shy about tagging along too much in another group’s work.
After we backed out, Group 2 seemed confused and a bit upset. Apparently, they were counting on us, especially for the part that needed our help. But we were confused too. if they really needed us, why keep asking if we were going? We thought it was just casual or optional. So AITA for backing out last minute? "
34,1jxay4n,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling on someone that was lying,"My partner’s cousin (Sara), myself and their other cousin’s girlfriend (Jane) are in the same social circle as we are related through our partner’s family. Sara has been making jealous and rude remarks regarding Jane and their children, we have been stuck in the middle hearing Sara make these statements as we luckily don’t have children. 

As Sara and Jane live closer together and share children of the same age, they are always hanging out together, which I find strange as Sara constantly makes rude remarks about Jane and her children but not to her face. To keep the family peace we have not shared these comments to Jane nor her boyfriend. I have shared smaller rude comments that Sara has made about Jane’s children to Jane. Jane’s bf and my fiancé have all had known issues with Sara on various occasions but it seems to be their family norm to ignore, she is known to talk badly and never admit to her faults. 

Recently it went too far as Sara blamed Jane’s kids for breaking a high value item. Neither cousin nor their partners were present during the situation but myself and the aunts (Sara’s mother and Jane’s MIL) were present. After the event cousin Jane’s mother in law, aunt to Sara, asked me what I saw about how the item was broken. I supported her telling her it was not her grandchild’s fault as it happened in front of us but she was misled into thinking noone could truly see what happened  (Sara was blaming Jane’s child but only behind Jane’s back.) Jane’s mil got very upset as she’s used to being gaslit into thinking things happened differently and after hearing my supporting description, she had a discussion where Jane  texted Sara upset about the blame. Sara denied as usual. 

Sara, after dinner and drinks with all cousins pulled me aside to ask what was said when I visited Jane’s mil. I explained to her that she wanted to see my point of view on how the incident happened, which I explained how her child caused the accident.
Sara was focusing on wanting to hear if I had told Janes MIL that she had blamed them, which I did not discuss, but she did in fact do. I am now bothered at how I was made to look like the asshole in the situation. I felt blindsided , she knows she’s been talking badly about Jane and feel that was my opportunity to discuss it with the group but as I wasn’t expecting it, I didn’t air her out as I should have. I still feel like contacting Sara to reassure her that I do remember the remarks she made and how she did in fact blame Jane’s child but it also feels useless as I know she will deny as usual and it is ridiculous to me to stoop to a liar’s level and explain to someone who is trying to gaslight that they said something that they know they said. We are inevitably going to continue in this social circle but I feel even less comfortable than I did before. What would you all do? AITA? "
35,1jxafyd,Not the A-hole,AITA for yelling at my (25F) boyfriend (25m) for putting himself in danger,"My boyfriend and i don’t live in the same city. He usually takes the bus home from work and suddenly he messages me tonight that someone is following him. I called him and he says that some sketchy guy looked like he was getting too close to him on the bus with his hands in his pocket. He didn’t want this guy following him home so he got off at the next stop at a college campus. The guy follows him off the bus and follows my bf again onto another bus getting uncomfortably closer. At the next stop my boyfriend runs to a restaurant and somehow he loses the guy but doesn’t know exactly where he went and that’s when I call him. I tell him to take a Lyft home so no one can follow him home on the bus. I kid you not, he insists on waiting for the next bus to another location to “investigate” what this guy’s intent is. In my head, you either call the police or get the heck out of there. I tell him that’s a bad idea because this guy will probably try to jump him if he sees him again. He starts arguing that by that logic he will have to start taking a Lyft everyday because this guy will be waiting and looking for him on the bus at the same time every day. I think even if this guy intends on finding him again another day, it would still be better to get out of there now so he can’t follow you home. Again I kid you not, we argue back and forth about this for 10 min, and I got so frustrated so I yelled at him “this is the worst logic”. Well he didn’t take that too kindly and so he gets butt hurt and proceeds to hang up on me and block my calls. I freak out because I won’t know if  he’s okay or not. He finally answers my call and says he took a Lyft home, says nothing else and blocks me again. I call him around 20 min later and he says he is home. I tell him how upset I feel that he blocked me because I was just worried about his safety. He tells me I wasn’t helping and he could’ve found out this guys intention. He blocks my calls again and I haven’t heard from him since.

Is it just me or is this immature behavior??? I felt like he was just trying to play detective. If he really felt in danger he should’ve called the police or get out of there, not try to “investigate” and give this guy another opportunity. 

Or AITA? Am I just being insensitive? Honestly he doesn’t have a good sense of danger sometimes so that was why I was getting upset that he would put himself in danger like that. I don’t know, any perspective is welcome."
36,1jx9zhs,Not the A-hole,AITA for making a frozen dinner for my boyfriend after work?,"so me (20F) and my bf (24M) been together almost 2 yrs. we got a 7 month old baby girl & i stay home with her while he works. sometimes me n the baby go to my moms just to chill or whatever while he’s at work. i do most of the cleaning n baby stuff, make food, all that.

he works security at a hospital, 12 hr shifts 4 days a week, leaves at like 7am and gets home around 7pm. in the mornings i usually make him something small before he leaves, like fruit or toast or cereal. nothing crazy, just quick stuff. I do pack his lunch for him the day before so he can just grab it and go

anyways, on wednesday i was feeling super drained. the day felt long as hell and i just didn’t have it in me to cook a whole dinner. so i just made one of those frozen tv dinners for us. steak, mashed potatoes, corn. I know it’s not the best thing ever, but he has eaten them before and hasn’t complained (yes i cut it up for the baby)

he came home, saw what i made, and just walked into our room. i thought he was changing but he never came back out. i went to check and he was mad. said after workin 12 hrs he expects a real cooked meal and that i don’t think about how he feels when he gets home.

like… i get it, i really do. but i’m tired too?? i got a baby hanging on me all day, cleaning the house, running around. some days i just don’t got the energy to be in the kitchen making a full meal.

now he’s been avoiding me and bringing back fast food instead of eating at home.
AITA for giving him a frozen dinner instead of cooking from scratch?"
37,1jx9nhf,Asshole,AITA for how I hung up a phone call?,"Coming to the good people of Reddit for some perspective.

Significant Other called me to discuss a personal matter while I was at work. I did state that I was at work and implied that I was on call for a client. We spoke for a few minutes. When my client walked in on the conversation, I hung up and texted SO when I had the opportunity.

SO said that it was disrespectful and uncivilized to just cut the call.

38,1jx9keh,Asshole,AITA for yelling at my wife for starting a hobby without me?,"Posting on throwaway as I'm not sure if she will see this. A couple of days ago I (28M) and my wife(26F) went to a craft store. She found a good deal on large fluffy yarn. She has always said how she wants to make a big fluffy crochet blanket. So she got a few bundles. 

I learned how to crochet from my grandma years ago. My wife has seen me crochet before and knows I know how to do it. She had suggested that I could teach her how to crochet after I am off work this weekend. She works a different shift then I do so our schedules line up sporadically. I was more than happy to teach her. 

Today I got home from work and found the packaging in the trash. She worked a later shift today so I didn't bother her while she slept. When she woke up I saw that she had already started without me. She had been bored and decided she would try on her own. She said she messed it up after the first few rows and will need to start again. I was very upset and angry. 

I keep crocheting because my grandma has since past away so I feel close to her every time I'm working on a project. This cut deep emotionally. I feel betrayed and not like I was valued in this. She tried to downplay that it was a big deal and that I was overreacting because ""I messed it up so I'll have to start over again"" and ""You can show me how to do it when I start over again"". I was really looking forward to spending time with her and showing her a skill I learned from family. I'm confused if I did overreact and it's not as big as I am making it out to be. Any advice is very much appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read. 

TL:DR My wife (26F) started crocheting from a video online after she asked me (28M) to show her how to do it as my grandma (who has passed) shower me how to. "
39,1jx9j1u,Not the A-hole,AITA for not allowing my husband to use my mom’s ring,"A little bit of background. My mom had an affair for YEARS with a good family friend. After my parents divorced over it, she stayed with him and my sister and I lived with them because it made more sense to be with our mom. I was 15 at the time and my sister was 19. They got engaged but it didn’t end up working out. It was a weird time in my life and I have very negative feelings towards him. 

Fast forward almost 25 years. I’m married with kids. Have a gorgeous wedding band/engagement ring that I love. I break my ring finger this past fall. In the ER they had to cut my rings in pieces. Very sad, but the rings are salvageable. I had to get surgery on the finger and the surgeon told me to wait a year to fix my rings because it would take that long for it to go back to its normal size. 

After the surgery, my mom calls me and tells me that she still has the engagement ring from that man and since my ring is in pieces, I was welcome to have it. This was a bit of a surprise. It’s easily a $35K ring. Gorgeous 2+ carat diamond platinum with an incredible setting and wedding band. It’s admittedly fucking beautiful. 

When I told my husband about it, he was very excited and encouraged me to jump on the opportunity. He loves jewelry. But I explained to him how I felt about it and we argued a bit about it because he couldn’t understand why I wouldn’t take it, etc etc. He felt like it was owed to me after everything I’ve gone through. In the end we ended up taking it after our visit over thanksgiving because my mom was just keeping it in her bathroom drawer and we have a large safe, so I figured it was best to keep it locked up. Then without my knowledge, my husband took it to a jeweler to get it appraised and has approached me with some ideas for redesigning my ring using my mom’s. He is trying to make it sound like he did me a favor and that this is beneficial for everyone. I have been very clear. Feel free to redesign my ring and use any other jewelry I have but do not touch my mom’s ring. It belongs to me, my sister, and my mom, and we will decide what to do with it. Furthermore, I don’t want that fucking man’s diamond on my finger. My stomach turns at the thought of him.

My husband thinks I’m being unreasonable and is angry about the fact that I can’t see that he’s trying to do a “good” thing and I don’t appreciate it. AITA? "
40,1jx8qdi,Not the A-hole,AITAH because I don’t want to go to a birthday party?,"For context, I’ve been friends with this person since we were toddlers. We share a lot of history together. 
  I(27F) have been friends with “Amy” (27F) for almost my whole life. Our parents are friends, and we spent practically our whole childhood together. It was more of a sisterhood bond if anything.
Recently in February, I have found out she was sharing my business with a girl we’ll call Heather (26F). I’m not friends with Heather, but I have met her a handful of times and we have each other on social media. Heather messaged me on social media and asked if she could call me and get my number. I was hesitant, but gave it to her because she said she needed to talk to me about Amy. 
   What she called to tell me shocked me but most of all hurt me. Heather, a girl I barely know, told me Amy called her and the topic of having kids came up, (Amy has 3 kids back to back, all toddlers). Amy proceeded to tell Heather I am more like an “aunt” figure, I wouldn’t be a good mom and she can’t see “motherhood going well for me.” (Her exact words according to Heather.) Amy proceeded to tell Heather about my fertility issues, and how I “can’t have kids.” (Again, her words according to Heather.) 
  It turns out, Heather was in the same boat as me and she her husband are going through IVF. And according to her, it made her upset and of course she felt some kind of way. 
   When I confronted Amy in text and told her I can’t trust her anymore and I have to cut ties she called me 10 times in a row to which I declined. She texted Heather “she knows” and “I can’t believe you went behind my back.” (Heather sent me screenshots.) 
Heather told her own heath issues to Amy, and told her she was wrong to tell someone else’s business and blocked her. Amy and Heather haven’t spoken since. 
   I, on the other hand, still have her via social media and she sends pictures of the kids to me and tries to tag me and send me videos. I heart the kids pictures and move on. 
Recently, she invited me to her children’s birthday parties. I just don’t feel comfortable, I wouldn’t feel right going to a “friends” event knowing what she said about me. And, she’s been more in contact than usual because I know she wants me to come. 
I don’t know what or where to go from here an I use our close past as an excuse. 
So, in conclusion, AITAH for not wanting to go? "
41,1jx8lu6,Asshole,"AITA for winning the stuffed animal my girlfriend had set up, and not giving it to her?","So reddit, I (18m) and my partner (19f) went to see the minecraft movie with some friends today. for context, me and another group of friends had gone the previous day at the same theater, and in this theater theres a corner with a claw machine with little plush keychains. 

i rarely buy myself stuffed animals, but while browsing the machines i saw one and i knew i had to have it. i immediately put 10 bucks into tokens, handed a few out to my friends (who bought snacks) and sank like 5 dollars all on this one little keyboard bunny rabbit keychain. 

when i was out of tokens and it was sitting right on the edge of the prize drop, i vowed to come back for this precious angel. i dont know what about this one specifically my heart was set on but i was ready to spend another 10 for this probably $1.50 keychain. 

fast forward to earlier today, were headed to the theater and i have one thing on my mind. as soon as were in the door i head over, and i cant find my card to get tokens. the keychain is right where i left it, and my friends and girlfriend are catching up and im praying they arent going to see my baby before i get the chance to win her myself. 

well, luck would have it, i couldnt find the card under all the candy i had smuggled in my pockets, and had to step outside to empty them find my card and come back. 

when i arrive, to my horror, my girlfriend is going for the exact one i had set up and wanted! i rush over to watch as im getting my tokens, she picks it up and my heart stops, and it falls EVEN CLOSER than it was before!!! when she was out of tokens, i put one in and immediately got it.  before i could celebrate she says ""i cant believe you just swooped in and got the one i set up"", which, i got a bit defensive at but couldnt say much as she had moved it closer. 

i feel a little bad and i think my friends judged me a bit for not just handing over the keychain but she has sooo many stuffed animals, she gets her own, she gets them as gifts, i get them for her and have won them for her before, i was just so dead set on this particular one. i spent the rest of my tokens trying to get a similar one for her but failed. i dont think shes super upset at me but i do kinda feel like a dick. AITA? 

EDIT: getting a lot of mixed responses on this post but the general consensus seems like im the asshole, im taking some of the commenters advice and ordering some plushies for her as we speak. when we see eachother sunday im going to communicate better what was going on with me in that moment, apologize, and hopefully i won't have done irreparable damage to my image as a partner 🤞 wish me luck!

42,1jx8k65,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my parents my sister is pregnant?,"Some context: I (22F) have been living on my own since I was 18, due to my family home situation. My older sister (27F), who has serious mental illnesses (BPD & Bipolar) and has moved in and out of my parents house for years now (she currently lives there). She had him when she was 22 and has never been able to properly care for him. 
Moving him around constantly, in and out of abusive/toxic relationships, addicted to drugs, been homeless, admitted to the hospital several times and hasn’t worked since she was first pregnant with him.

My parents essentially took over legal guardianship of my nephew, (court orders) he is the sweetest little boy but was diagnosed with high functioning autism, and is essentially non verbal at the age of 5. It has been a battle, helping raise him, learning new skills to parent him, and my parents are doing the absolute best and most for him. I visit consistently and help with him as often as I am able to. They are financially, emotionally and physically supporting him and my sister and have been ever since he was born.  

My sister and I are not close anymore, but she still talks to me when she needs something (money, help, rides etc) 
So a few weeks ago, she messaged me telling me she was expecting and sent the ultrasound and everything. I was dumbfounded, she is barely able to care for herself and the son she currently has, how the hell could she bring another child into this world and put that on my parents to raise yet another child, mind you my parents are 65+. 
I decided I needed to tell my parents, not really sure what they could do about the situation, but knowing it would affect them the most. They ended up asking her about it, and she absolutely flipped out and called me asking why the hell I would tell them. Telling me that she told me in confidence, and I could never be trusted, that I am a horrible sister and that I don’t believe in her. It caused a massive fight amongst my parents and sister and she is threatening to leave. We have not spoken since.

I’m left feeling hurt, sad, confused and frustrated for everyone. I have empathy for her and I know it is a struggle to live with these illnesses, but she isn’t actively doing anything to better her life for herself or her son. 
I feel conflicted because I know it wasn’t my place to tell them and she has every right to be mad at me so now I am left wondering, am I the asshole for revealing her pregnancy? 

Side note: it’s difficult for my parents to not “enable her” by caring for her and her son because they love him so much and don’t want him to have to suffer alongside, he deserves a stable, happy and healthy life.  "
43,1jx8euj,Not the A-hole,AITA for installing a lock on my bathroom?,"Hello all, F26 here, I live with M25 and M27 in a shared house that we rent. When we all first moved in here (about 6 months ago) we all signed agreements on certain things. One of those being that I will solely cover the cost of the water bill but the spare bathroom in the house is mine. This was all completely fine up until about 2 weeks ago. 

M27 I’ll call John for this, recently started using my shower randomly out of the blue. I figured maybe they ran into each other and he needed to shower quick for work and thought no biggie and that it wasn’t a big deal. This turned into John using my bathroom for everything, showering, going to the bathroom, shaving AND LEAVING HAIR EVERYWHERE, and I’ve had enough. I cleaned the entire bathroom and installed a lock on it with a key that only I have. After I did this John sent a message to our group chat saying, and I quote. “Why is the bathroom locked?? What is happening?” Now in the days leading up to this I spoke to my other roommate M25 and he agreed with me that I should lock it and be done with it and has zero issues with that one being mine (per our agreement). When John first sent that message I was just clocking into work so I sent a quick “because I pay extra for that bathroom to be solely mine”. And I left my phone in my locker. When I got on my break I came back to a bunch of messages in our group chat the highlights being “um no you do not” and “if I can’t use the bathroom in our fucking house I might just move out” and he was essentially just throwing a fit about the whole thing. AITA here?

44,1jx8eqc,Not enough info,WIBTA for telling my sister-in-law that her sister shouldn't join our family trip?,"There are five siblings in my husband's family. Their parent's passed away a few years ago. With some of the money they inherited from their parents, they decided to go on a cruise as adult siblings with spouses. My husband's, brother's, wife's (my sister-in-law we'll call Patty), sister (my sister-in-law's sister - we'll call her Bonnie) is a travel agent, and she agreed to help us book the cruise. I was grateful for her help in booking the cruise, until she started discussing rooms, and she had booked a room for herself and her husband right in the middle of the rest of our rooms. Bonnie had joked about joining us when we were on the zoom call the night before making plans, but we all laughed and I literally thought it was a joke. Turns out, the two sisters thought it would be a great idea for Bonnie and her husband to to join us (they would pay their own way). These two sisters are extroverted and energetic, and no doubt would dominate all conversations. I called my husband's sister (Janna) to get her thoughts, and she and her husband were upset to learn that this couple wanted to join us. We all felt this would interfere with our ability to talk openly about our family and the things that are unique to this sibling group. My own siblings went on a similar cruise and it would have been extremely awkward if one of the in-laws had invited their sibling to join us. No one that was upset about this couple joining our cruise was willing to rock the boat and bring up this concern, so I had to be the bad guy. My sister-in-law, Patty, immediately apologized and said that her sister and husband would not join us. That was a couple months ago. Since then, Janna and her spouse had to back out - which we are all sad about. My brother-in-law just called my husband and said that his wife's sister, Bonnie, still really wants to come on the cruise with us, and now that the sister that was opposed to them joining has dropped out, they want to know if we would be okay with them joining us. I cannot understand how they would even think this is okay. This sibling group has never done a trip like this before, and who knows if an opportunity like this will ever come up again. I really think that having this couple, that doesn't belong to this sibling group, will completely alter the dynamics of the group and make things awkward. At this point, I feel like no matter what we decide, it will be awkward. If we say that we would prefer for it to just be our little sibling group so we can have a nice bonding experience, Patty and her husband will harbor hard feelings. If we say, go ahead and join us, we won't have that bonding experience and everything will be awkward because they will know that we would have preferred to not have the outside couple join us.

WIBTA to say no, again, to them joining us?"
45,1jx89xn,Not the A-hole,AITA because my friend (20F) thought I wanted her boyfriend (20M) and I had no idea??,"I had a friend in college for a while, we were decently close with each other I’d say. I also knew her boyfriend before they dated. When she told me she liked him, I even encouraged them to get together. I swear to god, I’ve never seen him in any way more than a friend, as he was also very openly bi and quite feminine, I always saw him as more of a girl friend.

The three of us were quite close at one point, because they knew that I liked someone else and was helping me with it. But as time passed on and as I started getting in a relationship with my boyfriend, I come to find out that she’s been shittalking me the whole time telling him that I’m a terrible person that wants her boyfriend. Granted, I know my boyfriend and her were also close friends, but it was genuinely so shocking for me to find that she thought all these terrible things about me without me knowing.

Looking back, I don’t think there was much I did that indicated that I liked him. She claims that I have explicitly told a mutual friend that I liked him, which would be an ABSURD thing to say out loud, let alone a mutual. However, I will say I could have been more attentive to how she felt and noticed things earlier on. We always had a very bantering friendship, and remember once when they were together, I was texting them both at the same time. She asked me what we talked about, I thought she was joking with me since he’s right next to her and there’s no way she can’t already see the messages. She then proceeded to say that I’m not a girl’s girl, which I was really confused about but just joked and said sure you’re right i’m not a girls girl for you. Retrospectively, I obvious would not have said that and treated it like a joke, but I genuinely had no idea she was actually suspicious of us. Other than this instance, I’ve never hung out with him 1 on 1, called/facetimed, or text extensively. 

Once I found out about this, I asked my boyfriend to ask her if she’d like to ever talk and clear things up. She got mad at him for bringing it up and said that she will never talk to me. Since then, my boyfriend has kind of just let their friendship die down, and nothing much has happened. I do feel very bad carrying the guilt that I have inflicted harm upon someone else, and I really wanted the opportunity to apologize for my oversight. It makes me feel awful knowing that someone thinks of me so poorly and yet I had no idea of it. Moving forward, I’m not sure if I should just leave this in the past, implore my boyfriend to reconnect with her, or try reaching out again. "
46,1jx6ta4,Not the A-hole,"AITA for asking a kid, in public, to stop yelling?","TL;DR: Guy's kids were yelling at the top of their lungs in a small post office packed with people, guy wasn't doing anything at all. I asked the kid to please stop yelling, guy got pissed. AITAH? 

Context: I was at the post office helping my mom fill out and send a bunch of certified mail. It's a very small office, probably 30x40 ft, and it was packed with people, probably about 15 people, including two kids. At first they were playing, being a bit loud but whatever, they're kids.

But then one of them started screeching at the top of their lungs, they'd go ""yyyAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"" incredibly loudly for like 3-5 seconds at a time, it was physically painful to my ears. Parents are nowhere to be seen. After about 3 minutes of this, an older man walks past the kids on his way out, and the kid let's out another screech as he walks by, old man stops, look at the kid and calmly says ""cut it out"" before walking out. Kid screeches again, I look at her and say ""could you please stop screaming?"", then go back to doing whatever I was doing. Then the dad starts saying, from across the room ""hey, chill out, they're 2 years old"", and whenever I tried saying anything he'd just cut me off and say ""no, chill out"". Kids looked older than two years old to me, but I may be wrong. At this point someone else (not sure if it was the same old man from earlier) also starts telling the guy to control his kids, to take them outside or leave them with someone. At this point I didn't keep arguing. Dad doesn't really do anything to stop his kids, just ignores them. 

Dad then says on his way out ""go home and drink a beer, stop being so fucking miserable"". AITAH? "
47,1jx6rkb,Not enough info,AITA for saying my boyfriend's friend can't visit us now that I'm pregnant?,"My boyfriend has a friend who is currently doing the whole #vanlifing thing and living out of his van. The past several months, this friend has been coming by our house a couple days a week. Each time he's here, he stays around 10 to 12 hours to use the shower, kitchen, washing machine, and WiFi. I've been unhappy with the lack of privacy and the extra work for quite a while, which my boyfriend is well aware of, but have been putting up with it because the friend is down on his luck and could use some help.

However, now that I'm pregnant, I'm ready for this situation to end. I want to be able to lay on my couch without pants, not shove my giant, tired boobs into a bra constantly, and talk about my private medical details with my partner without having to whisper about them in another room. I'm also just worn out in general, and the friend is generating so much extra work. He comes into our home after doing construction jobs and tracks in tons of dust and dirt. Every time he showers he somehow leaves a thick coating of body hair all over the shower I have to clean up before I can shower again. After he uses the washing machine there's sticks and leaves and sand all over the laundry room. Not only does he hog the kitchen when I want to cook meals sometimes, but he also leaves all his dirty dishes for me to deal with afterwards. Ideally, I'd have my boyfriend deal with the extra work, since he's the one who's inviting the dude over, but with his busier work schedule, most of the household work falls to me.

So to me, it's a no-brainer that the friend finds somewhere else to be for a couple months to give me some privacy and a break from the added work. However, when I brought this up to my boyfriend and told him it was time to set a boundary with the friend, he told me it was first of all, a very awkward and weird thing to ask his friend, and secondly, a cruel and insensitive thing for me to request. He's willing to do so for me, but at the same time, is making it very clear he thinks I'm a monster for even asking him to do this. Is it actually reasonable for me to put a no-visitors rule in place for a few months or not?"
48,1jx6knk,Asshole,AITA for telling my mom I’ll never forgive her if she fucks up my adoption,"I’ve (14f) been living with my aunt (my mom’s sister) since I was 8. It was originally because of an issue with her ex boyfriend and CPS placed me with my aunt then she used to say she couldn’t handle 4 kids as a single mom so I had to stay with my aunt then we just didn’t talk for a few years. 

My aunt has been trying to adopt me for years. We’re finally able to try to get my mom’s parental rights terminated because she didn’t speak to any of us or send money or anything for 4 years. I really like living with my aunt. On Tuesdays we go out to eat. She says we take turns choosing the restaurant but I get to choose almost every week. On Fridays we order pizza and watch a movie and eat ice cream in our pajamas on the couch. When I started middle school she started taking me to get my nails done with her so now we do that every other Saturday and at least once a month (sometimes more during summers or school breaks) we get to visit her condo in the mountains. There’s a little beach and the past couple years she’s been letting me hang out with my friends or alone by the beach or downtown or at the pool or wherever as long as I keep my location on my phone and I’m home by the time it gets dark. 

After my mom got notice that her rights were going to be terminated she got in contact with my aunt and started emailing my old email address saying she misses me and she wants to see me. She’s sent me pictures of her new family and she’s sending my aunt money so she can say she’s a part of my life and she’s taking care of me. 

My aunt told me not to contact my mom yet and to let her take care of everything. I listened for a while then my mom sent me a picture of a bed at her house with a bunch of shopping bags on it and she said that’s my bed and she has presents for me and she can’t wait for me to come home. I emailed her back and told her that I don’t want to live with her. I haven’t seen her or talked to her for 4 years and I don’t even know who half the people in the pictures she sent me are. I also said that I really love living here and that if she fucks up my adoption I’ll never forgive her and I’ll never speak to her after I turn 18. 

My mom called my aunt crying about what I said and my aunt got mad at me because she told me not to contact my mom. Now I’m wondering if I was the asshole for contacting my mom when I wasn’t supposed to and being rude to her. "
49,1jx6igv,Not the A-hole,AITA for selling remodel items after the “rent to own” landlords breached contract?,"Hello! I have been in a rent to own contract since 2019 with a person I have known for a long time. His family has always been very friendly to me and vice versa. When entering the contract he stated “the longer you’re here the cheaper the cost of the house will be” we agreed I would get a loan for the house asap. 
Fast forward to Covid… I moved my disabled mom home from the nursing home and an assistive technology company helped with the cost of the remodel. He signed each plan and document regarding the repairs and contract with the company. 
I had a child in 2021. When I remodeled the upstairs bathroom due to mold and mildew I didn’t want my child around. I paid for this out of my own pocket. I replaced two windows that were broken and installed a new split ac/heater unit. While fixing several plumbing issues and central ac unit issues for the downstairs apartment. 
In 2022 his wife informed me that the taxes for the property increased therefore the rent payment increased as well. I agreed to pay the increase as this was in our original agreement. After which she replied that they want to appraise the house and get it put on the market. I asked what was left on the mortgage and was given an agreeable amount. I tried to apply for loans and even spoke to the lender of the original home loan. Wifey sent me a contract which I forwarded to the loan officer… he advised me not to sign as it was bogus and obviously pulled from an online source with very little information changed to accommodate the situation. I did not sign this and explained why. To which she replied they would not assist with down payment and required 20% down payment. I asked the husband (original contract owner) to please come to the property and see what improvements I have made he replied “will do.” I haven’t seen or spoken to them since. 
Until March 10th when wifey explained that the taxes increased again they would like it to be under contract within 90 days and they will put a for sale sign up after an appraisal. She also increased the total cost of the house by $16000. 
Come to find out hubby lied when I moved in. He cashed the insurance check for a new roof and never fixed it…. Literally no one can get a loan for an incurable home. 
We are moving out and she said that they are not liable for the repairs made by the assistive technology company or the ones I paid for out of pocket. So I have been advised to sell all of the items I put into the property… 
Am I the asshole? "
50,1jx6cwj,Not the A-hole,"AITA: I told my friend about her boyfriend breaking a promise, and now im being painted as the “jealous boy bestfriend”","I was best friends with a girl who is very serious about not wanting to be around smoking because of family issues, and I know this specifically because she had a thing with my best friend and made him quit smoking. A few months later, she started getting to know this guy at our school who was kind of known as someone who was big on smoking, and as her best friend I wanted to make sure she knew about this. I told her, and she brung it up to him and he swore to her that she would never smoke again. They started dating, and that was that. I still stayed best friends with her and we were just as close as before. About a week later, I was using the bathroom in school when I saw him ask his friend for a puff of his cigarette and ask if he could buy him a pack.  He didn't see me, but of course I was trying to be a good friend and I told his girlfriend what I saw. She believed me at first and thanked me for telling her, but a week later suddenly started calling me a liar and claiming I made that up because I was ""jealous of her relationship"". I didn't really care about this because I knew I wasn't jealous, but I was offended that my then best friend was calling me a liar. I continued on as normal and we remained friends, although slightly less close. Around a month after all of this, someone else in my school made an instagram post where my friends boyfriend could be seen holding a cigarette in the background, so me trying to prove that I wasn't a liar sent it to my friend. I then got a text from the person who posted the picture being furious that I was getting involved, followed by a very angry and disrespectful paragraph by my friend about how I was trying to ruin her happiness by messing up her relationship over something that wasn't true. I know I probably shouldn't have gotten involved, but at the end of the day I was just trying to make sure she didn't get hurt. Am I the asshole?? "
51,1jx63vj,No A-holes here,AITA for not taking my GF to an event instead of playng DND with my friends?,My GF wants to go to a game collab event that has special commemorative merch. The best chance for her to get it is either to get up unusually early or to go on a different date. She does not want to go without me for personal reasons (social anxiety basically). I have D&D planned for that different date and it is likely if I cancel the D&D we won't get another chance to meet up before summer rolls around. AITA for thinking that higher chance of getting merch - a postcard basically - is not worth denying my quality time with friends?
52,1jx5x1i,Not the A-hole,AITA for not bringing home the family cat sooner?,"I (25M) got a text a little over a week ago from my dad (50-something M), telling me he would be out of town for ""a week starting Thursday"" to visit my mom who's out of town until later summer and asking if I could take the family cat during that time. For context, I am a college student and I live on my own about an hour away from my parents.

On Tuesday he texted me saying he got back and asking for the cat back, I said I couldn’t bring her back until Thursday, and asked why he was back early. He said he was “rounding” when he said it would be a week. Over that day and the next he sent me several, increasingly demanding messages, demanding the cat back sooner then Thursday.

I finally got around to bringing the cat back yesterday, and while I was there he told me that he ""felt a little bad faith"" in the communication about getting the cat back. That made me really angry! From my perspectively, he clearly indicated that he wouldn't be back until Thursday, and then was suddenly demanding I, a busy college student at the end of the semester, drop everything, and take 2 hours out of my day to bring him the cat immediately when he (to me) clearly indicated he’d be back thursday (the day I planned for). An argument ensued, and I left feeling rather angry, telling him I wasn’t happy with how he talked to me, and demanding an apology.

Today he sent me a message with half an apology, saying he felt bad and didn’t mean to offend me, but doubling down that I was “taking advantage a little bit” and that he “interpreted it as a bit of bad faith”. I sent a furious response, pointing out the miscommunication was his, calling his use of “bad faith” insane, and ending my message with “Quite frankly, never ask me for a favor again if you’re going to treat me like this”. His response said (among other things) “How about if I take back the ‘slightly bad faith,’ … and replace it with ‘slightly exaggerated your lack of availability’?”. He included in there a few kinder statements (“By the way, I respect your strong disinclination towards dishonesty, I’m glad you take pride in it”), but he didn’t back down from his accusations of bad-faith. I obviously didn’t find that adequate, and sent another furious response saying, among other things , that he needed to take responsibility for the poor communication, apologize for how he handled it and what he said, and finishing with “You are not in charge anymore dad. I am 25, and I live on my own. We are peers, full stop. You do not get to lecture me anymore, and especially not when I am doing you a favor.”

Am I the asshole here? The thing I’m upset about is not really the miscommunication about his return date, or even the entitlement I felt in him demanding the cat back immediately and with no heads up, but mostly that he would dare say I was acting in bad faith. That term means bad intentions, or dishonesty, and I find that accusation very offensive when I thought I was doing him a favor in the busiest time of the semester. "
53,1jx5o7j,Not the A-hole,AITAH if we say “no”?,"Our Grandchild called wanting to meet us this weekend.  Forgive me for giving you the backstory.  His  father told him when he was a junior in high school that he should and could go to college in London.  We tried to be real with him and tell him how much money college costs.  And that he should research costs especially in this state, compared to out of state.  He basically ignored us for two years.  Unfortunately he has parents who filll him with fantasies and then they can’t deliver.  We’ve been clear with all of our children that we paid for the half dozen of them as far as they wanted to go, but we would not be able to help their children.  That we’re not a bank.  We have a child who went to two technical schools and still is not self sufficient.  That child is married to a person who is the supporter.  Another child has been incredibly self sufficient.  Successful military career and a master’s in education.  Another is a doctor.  One is a lab tech.  Another is a computer programmer.  One is a teacher.  Last but not least we have a lab tech.  They are all imdependent of is.  I will say it was a long road and a difficult one.  We thought we were done.  We currently have issues, health and financial challenges, but we are lucky to live a good life.  Also throughout our lives we’ve dedicated ourselves to treating our entire family equally.  We gave  each of them the opportunity to buy a home.  We did write the checks to the mortgage company.  Anyway, we feel if we help one grandchild we would need to do do the same for the others.  Where would it stop?   Back to this Grandson, in the end he did not take our advice.  Applied only to out of state schools and got scholarships for example $10 k / year for 4 years.  When these letters of acceptance came in we told him to work with his parents to figure out what other costs was there.  Well he accepted a school that’s 47,000 per semester.  AITAH for not wanting to do this? BTW my spouse agres with me.  So its actually are we the assholes.  We have to grandchildren past this phase one is a student at a State University, the other is a housewifr with 2 beautiful babies.  "
54,1jx3t03,Not the A-hole,AITA for going out to eat when my husband is working late shifts?,"My husband and I work different shifts. I worked first shift and he works a late second shift. So we don’t often eat dinner together because he leaves for work right before I get home and he gets home from work after I am asleep. 

We also have very different tastes in foods. He has a more basic, American food based diet and he also loves seafood. I love foods from other cultures, but I don’t like seafood. Because of this, when we are home together we cook different meals and eat it together. If I make something he likes, I’ll ask if he wants some. If he makes something I like, he does the same. But we always eat together on our days off, whether it be eating out on a date or eating cooked food at home. We’ve been doing this for years and it’s worked. 

But since we work different shifts, 5 to 6 days per week, I am eating dinner alone. I usually cook, but a couple times per month, I go out to a restaurant that serves food he doesn’t like to have dinner. When we are talking later, I usually tell him how I had something from a restaurant and he asks how it was and I tell him. No biggie. 

The other day I was out trying a Peruvian restaurant recommended by a coworker. My husband and I had looked at the menu and he didn’t see anything he was particularly looking forward to on it, so I added it to my list of places to go when he works. And I went that day. He got out of work early and called me and I told him where I was. And he got mad. 

I finished up and went home and he was upset and asked how long this has been going on for. I was confused because he knows I do this. But apparently he thought I did pickup or delivery. I tend to eat in because I don’t want dishes at home. He also can’t really explain why he is so mad, but it seems he’s mad I’m out dining alone? I just go out, get food, and read while I wait and eat. Then I come home. It’s always food he won’t like as well, so I go alone so I can have it. 

He hasn’t been really talking to me since it happened. The conversations are short and cold and it makes me feel like I did something wrong by doing this for years and not specifying I eat in the restaurant to do it. He has never acted this way about anything else, he has always been very kind and willing to work through any issues we have. So I am not sure what’s different with this. 

AITA for going out to eat alone and not specifying to my husband that I ate in the restaurant?

56,1jx38bk,Not the A-hole,AITA for erasing the chore chart?,"My boyfriend and I have lived together for 2 years. We fight a lot tbh. It’s always something stupid, but I’m pretty sure this stupid fight is going to end our relationship. 

One thing we fight the most about is chores. He believes he does so much more than me. I think he doesn’t. In all truthfulness, he takes majority care of our 3 cats (2 mine 1 his), he takes out the trash, and we each do our own dishes and laundry (except towels, I do all of them). So all deep cleaning and regular maintenance is on me. We both wanted to stop fighting so much. So we mutually agreed on a chore chart. At the beginning of the week, we split up chores in a way we felt fair and left a few to just be done by either of us. 

2 days ago, he came home and saw I marked off picking up the living room. So he asked what all that entailed because I had already done it and he didn’t think there had been anything to pick up. At the moment, I was dealing with a huge issue with my bank account. So I told him it wasn’t much that day, just a cat bowl and some trash. He kept going on about what trash and what did I even pick up. I was dealing with my issue and kept saying I didn’t look at the trash, it wasn’t a whole lot, and asking if he could wait. After I dealt with my issue I was still super stressed and felt like I was going to throw up. But he just kept going on. So I got up and just erased the board. I was already run down from a long day at work, exhausted from minimal sleep, and just tired of fighting. 

I tried talking to him yesterday but he said “I don’t want to have to give you the silent treatment and scold you like a child, but you need to grow up. You have zero control of your emotions.” 


AITA? Do I really have zero control? We literally got the board to stop fighting, but if it’s causing even more issues then there’s no point. I"
57,1jx30w2,Not the A-hole,AITA for not offering my work besties friend more help to prep for an interview?,"I (F29) work with my friend James (M40) at a tech company. He referred his friend from a previous job who he considers a sister (F45) to come and work at our company.

Prior to the interview there is a mathematical  test which she has questions about and I happily answered them. 
She passed the math test and progressed to the Zoom interview. 

Now it just so happened that her interview was with me and my boss. 

The interview was on Wed and my friend James calls me on Tuesday to ask for the questions. To which I respond in a casual way ‘you know I cannot give you those’ which he accepts and we move on. 

Wednesday the interview takes place and she doesn’t do well. The interview questions are basic such as how do you prioritise your workload, what’s the most innovative thing you’ve done at work etc.. 

As she doesn’t do well she doesn’t pass to the next stage. 

Now my friend is mad at me because I didn’t help her more to prep for the interview? 

He thinks because she is a sister to him I should have read between the lines that she needed help and helped more..? 

From my point of view the fact that I was doing the interview in the first place was crossing an ethical line and I wasn’t comfortable doing more. 

If it was so important for him that I help her he should have said so? 

I have said all of the above with him but he’s still set in his ways that I dropped the ball and I was selfish by not helping her. For context I’m not friends with this person, we have met 4/5 times socially. "

Lady i was sitting next to gave me an ugly look and told me i shouldn’t be reading “that stuff” in public. I asked her what she meant and she clarified that she meant “sexual material”. I told her it was a psychology book, not erotica and that even if it was she should mind her business. The cover is mostly black, but there’s a man in a suit and a lady’s leg with a high heel on the cover, however the cover overall is designed to be so dark that i have a hard time even seeing those images on the cover when i’m holding it up in front of my face. it’s very subtle. the cover has the subtitle “understanding bdsm sexuality and communities”. I feel as though i’m allowed to read whatever material I want on a plane, especially so because the intention of this book isn’t to turn anyone on. Like i said, it’s a psychological study. It’s not like i was breathing heavy and jacking off next to her. but maybe im wrong? AITA?"
59,1jx2hhv,Not the A-hole,AITA for choosing to go to my bfs for Palm Sunday instead of the second Passover seder (i am converting to Catholicism),"edit: not important but i just realized i said my bf is 18, he’s 21 anyway 
okay so i (f18) have been dating my bf (m18) for a couple months. over a year before i met him i’ve begun converting to Catholicism from Judaism. he is also Catholic. i invited him to the first night of Passover seder at my aunts house, where my parents and grandma will also be. he invited me to his family for Palm Sunday, the following day, which would also be the second Passover seder. i said yes. my parents (who are still Jewish, though not religious in the slightest, and are mad i’m converting) are upset and saying i have loyalty issues for choosing to go to Palm Sunday. truth is, even if i never met my bf (so glad i did, i love him), I’d still have gone to Church, and i’m very excited as a Catechumen to be able to celebrate the holidays with people. my grandma has been trying to guilt me as well my mom gets mad whenever she sees my bfs crucifix necklace and my dad has gone to the extreme of calling Jesus, splayed out on the cross a rag doll. i hate the divide this is causing. i do believe i will end up marrying this man, Lord willing; but regardless, i am under the impression that i’m not making the wrong choice. but i’m sick of being told i’m disloyal when that’s far from the truth.

so, am i the asshole for not going to the second seder? "
60,1jx25j1,Not enough info,AITA for grounding my son even though he was 'exposing’ a bad teacher?,"This whole thing has me spiraling, and I genuinely don’t know if I did the right thing.

My 13-year-old son came home a few weeks ago ranting that he failed a history test because his teacher “hates him.” He was visibly upset, and I went full protective-parent mode. I immediately emailed the school, demanding a meeting with the principal and the teacher. I was ready to go in and fight for him. 

Well, plot twist—I get to the meeting, and they sit me down and show me screenshots. My son had been secretly recording his teacher during class and posting the clips online. There were some videos of the teacher just talking smth. One caption for example was: ""When we try to tell her something is hard, she just shrugs and says, ‘Figure it out.’ Like, what’s the point of having a teacher then?” – These videos had thousands of views. I had no idea he was doing this and I was shocked.

I apologized right there and told the school I supported whatever disciplinary action they felt was appropriate. They ended up suspending him for two weeks. I myself told my son that no social media for 2 weeks. 

My son told me that one time that teacher told him he is the worst student in entire class because he couldn’t explain something from the textbook. Hearing this as a mom 💔

After the suspension, I started getting messages from other parents, some even thanked me. Apparently, rumors about the teacher’s behavior had been circulating, and some felt my son was just “exposing the truth” and being brave. A few even suggested I appeal the suspension and defend him more publicly.

But I can’t shake how wrong it feels. Secretly recording someone, especially a teacher, without their consent? I’ve told my son that even if the teacher is problematic, there are better ways to handle it.   

At the same time I know my son, he wasn’t trying to hurt anyone—he genuinely felt like he was standing up for himself and for others in the class. He just didn't do it in a right way.

So now I’m stuck: AITA for not defending him more and letting him get suspended? Or did I do the right thing by holding him accountable?

61,1jx2313,Asshole,AITA for walking heavily and being upset that I was woken up from a much needed nap for a second time in less than 30 minutes?,"In the last two nights, I have gotten 6 or 7 hours of sleep. 

In the last two days, I've been doing a lot of physically intensive work around the house and running errands for the family. Finally, everything was done. It was 8 pm, and I could finally lie down to nap before I had to be up to do something at 2 am.  Around 10 pm, I was woken up by my family being loud in the living room.  My eldest and her boyfriend had come over for dinner, and my wife and other kids were excited and joking.  I didn't gripe, I didn't get upset about being woken up.  I just went out into the back yard where I have a tool shed turned office, and I was going to just sleep in my recliner.  

About 30 minutes later, just long enough for me to finally fall back asleep, my daughter's dog started to howl at the back door to be let in. Even though the family was just on the other side of the sliding glass door, nobody heard her and it woke me up. This woke me up, and with an upset expression on my face and my steps being heavier than normal, I let the dog in and got me a glass of water.  When I explained what had happened, there wasn't any anger in my voice, I wasn't loud. I just stated what had happened. 

I was just informed by my wife that this ruined the mood for the evening, and my daughter and her boyfriend went home early. Further, I was informed that my reaction was inappropriate, that I shouldn't have been walking so heavily and should have schooled my face more. AITA?

But here’s the issue: I’ll be responsible for the event, and I’m really worried about the kids — specifically my younger nephews (ages 4–10).

I love them, and I’m the “fun uncle” who takes them out a lot. But they don’t have much self-control in public settings. Last week at Top Golf, they kept running into the play area, wouldn’t sit still, and I ended up having a full-blown anxiety attack trying to keep them safe while the adults barely helped.

This party will mostly be adults, and a rooftop isn’t exactly a safe space for wild, unsupervised kids. So I suggested we make it adults-only. My mom was offended and said the kids should be there to celebrate. I get that, but I’m the one on the hook if anything goes wrong — and history tells me I’ll end up babysitting again.

I don’t want to be the bad guy, but I also don’t want a disaster at my job.

AITA?


*****UPDATE*****
Here’s some things that are up for consideration. The rooftop is gated, specifically 3 feet 5 inches. I voiced my concern with my Mom and my OTHER sibling. My mom sounded like she understood the issue and was willing to come to a compromise. -Maybe someone babysits the children in a separate room. 

-Sister says that she would designate a specialized seating area for them as the venue has patio furniture we’ll use. - Which is fine, but who’s to say they’ll hold the children accountable and actively sitting down…As of now, I’m leaning towards the latter, but I think that I might wind up being the one responsible for sitting in the hotel room with them. 

______Update____

Sorry, I should’ve clarified. While I did offer to coordinate the gathering. I’m NOT the one who chose the space, my mother and siblings did. And I did express my concerns before they submitted the application to reserve the spot. 

However, I’m hearing you all loud and clear. I’m going to make a reservation for a suite for them to go to and maybe play video games to keep them occupied. They can come out for pictures and such and give hugs, HI’s and Bye’s, because I’d much rather not stress anyone out, including myself. "
63,1jx1uzw,Not the A-hole,AITA for ruining my cousin and friend's holiday?,"Me (F) and my cousin (let's call her Louise) get along alright, we don't talk a lot but when we're together, we had a lot of fun and talk about almost everything really. Our friend (""May"") is closer to Louise, as their parents are really close and they get along well, but when we were younger, me and May were best friends. I don't really talk to May now, as I guess we've just grown apart, but Louise and May have increasingly grown extremely close. 

The other month, when I was visiting family, a post came up on Louise's Snapchat story and May's one too. They were together in like a jacuzzi or something, I don't really know. I didn't know that they were going to hang out, and neither did anyone else in the family either (apart from my uncle and May's family, because they were there). At the time, I didn't know this and I thought that everyone knew and I just hadn't been told. Innocently and not in a sabotaging way whatsoever, I said ""Oh, I didn't know that Louise and May were going away together"" and showed my 2 family members that I was with the story. It instantly became clear that they had not been aware of this and were clearly angry and annoyed. They called my uncle and May's mum and were very angry that they had gone away without them knowing. It sounds stupid but it's good to note that my uncle and May's mum had asked my grandmother if it would be okay to take my cousin away (she's always been really close with them and May's family) to which she said no, for fear that I would feel left out and replaced. 

Now, my grandmother is not speaking to May's mum or family and is still pissed with my uncle. My grandmother says that it's nothing to do with me or what happened that's the reason to why she isn't talking to May's family, but I don't believe her. I feel even more awful about it, as recently my cousin told me that when this all happened, she had several panic attacks and everyone was crying and shouting (while they were still away on holiday somewhere). I feel so guilty and absolutely disgusted with myself that I was the cause of so my drama and even panic attacks. I didn't mean anything malicious of what I did. AITA? "
64,1jx1g65,Not enough info,AITA parking on the street,"I have a question about neighbourly behaviour:
	•	My family has five cars—one for each person and our driveway only fits two, so typically three cars are parked on the street (though usually, one of us isn’t home, so it’s often just two).
	•	The neighbours across the road have three cars and a trailer. Their driveway fits one car and the trailer, so they usually have two cars parked on the street as well.
	•	Recently, they spoke to my landlord and asked us not to park on the street in front of their house, saying those spots are “theirs.”

Is this a reasonable request? The road is public property.

For context: we don’t live on a busy street, and if the spots in front of their house are taken, there are always other available ones—though they might be a bit further up the hill, since our street is on a slope."
65,1jx1cof,Everyone Sucks,AITA for forcing the other team to pay rent in a state finals monopoly competition?,"For context I’m a HS student. The completion I was in was the 2nd round and only the top teams went on.  It’s teams of 2 controlling one piece.  

Early in the game I got a red property, which the next turn another team of two girls landed on. As soon as they landed I half-jokingly said, “Rent please.” 

But…

They just said no. I was confused and thought they were joking, so I said, “Oh, I just meant that you landed on my property.” 

And…
 they still said no?

Then they handed the dice to the next group. I tried to intervene and dictated that they literally have to pay, it’s the rules. The other 2 groups just say, “Just don’t make them pay, it’s slowing the game down.” 

I said that their group not paying was slowing the game down, not me. 

They didn’t take the well…

I ended up having to go find a proctor to force the team to pay, and after that everyone at the table villainized me? 

I was very polite about it, but after that the other groups just made up their minds to actively sabotage me? Didn’t make trades, tried to not pay several more times, and just insulted me to my face. 

AITA for sticking to the rules?

Now, it seems that these other two friends hurt her and she distanced herself from them, but they don't seem to have done anything too serious and they do me good too.

So for a while now, Hannah has apparently been making jokes like ""Oh, you cheated on me with them, they stole everything I have, etc."", but it seems that it wasn't just a joke. I've already written apology letters for her feeling betrayed twice and I don't want to have to choose between people I love. Depending on what they've done, I might even understand and start to have a different perception of them, but she doesn't tell me anything, and she doesn't have to tell me either, but I also don't think she has the right to demand that I start hating a person she hates just because yes.

Now she sent me messages about it and forwarded an audio from another friend of hers about the situation saying that it's common sense to stay away from people who have hurt a true friend's feelings, BUT THEY ARE ALL TRUE FRIENDS and they are also confused and don't seem to realize why they hurt her, and Hannah also doesn't respond when they ask what happened, idk what i should do.

69,1jx0n4l,Not the A-hole,AITA for missing my best friend's engagement party because of my boyfriend's business event?,"**AITA for missing my best friend's surprise engagement party because of my boyfriend's business event?**

Hi Reddit! This is my first post here, so apologies if I mess anything up — I'm just feeling super conflicted and could use some outside perspective.

So I (24F) have been best friends with my best friend (also 24F) for the last 17 years. Her boyfriend is proposing in May 2025, and I recently found out he's throwing her a surprise engagement party on **May 17th**. When he texted me about it, I was *immediately* excited — like literally jumping-up-and-down kind of excited. I’ve been waiting for this moment for *so* long.

But then it hit me… I won’t even be in the same **state** that day.

My boyfriend (29M) started his own small business a few years ago, and I’ve been helping him build it from the ground up. It’s still in the growth phase — not big enough to quit our weekday jobs, but it’s doing well and has real potential. For the last 3 years, we work a huge out-of-state event in May that’s our biggest opportunity to make sales and network. Its around the same time every year and this year we have to be there from **May 14th–19th**.

We’ve done this event for three years now, but last year was the first time we actually sold his stuff. This year will be the 2nd time. The problem is, the event only allows us to have **two** vendor credentials to work under his name and the help we trust (friends/family) either can’t make it or can only commit to part of the event — which doesn’t work. It's basically either both of us go, or he's left alone.

I’ve gone back and forth on this. Part of me feels like I’m the worst friend ever for not being at this huge moment in her life. But the other part of me feels like I’d be screwing over my boyfriend and something we’ve worked *so hard* for if I bailed.

Of course, I fully plan to take her out and celebrate the second I’m back. I want to be there for everything else — just not this **one** party. But I’m scared she’s going to feel like I let her down.

So… AITA for choosing to go to this business event instead of my best friend’s surprise engagement party?

Edit : Her boyfriend lives in a different state so its not easy for him to be able to reschedule as that is when he is scheduled to be here and its the day after he is proposing. I know my best friend will understand because that is the relationship that we have with each other. I just had my son (first kid) a little over a year ago so I have been very distant from my friends. It has not been a bad thing, I have just been exhausted so going out to bars just is not for me anymore. This has never caused hostility between us but it adds on to me feeling guilty because I have already been so distant the last year. She always just says that she understand and is there for me just like we always are, I have just felt like a REALLY shitty friend the last year.

  
Also I did let her boyfriend know earlier today and let him know. I have also been talking with my friends mom as I see her once a week and let her know as well.

TL;DR: Best friend’s surprise engagement party is May 17. I’ll be out of state that week working my boyfriend’s biggest business event of the year. We can’t find help to replace me, and our vendor credentials only allow two people. I want to be there for everything else, just not this one event. AITA?"
70,1jwzq2n,Asshole,AITA for choosing my girlfriend over my girl bestf,"me(M) and my girl bestf had been friends since 5 years 
we always has this tension going on between us it was clearly always more than friends.
we never felt like ruining the friendship because it was too pure. 
although we have fooled around before and made out once.
she has always been there for me throughout and even during my girl problems and i have been there for her too,we were never exclusive and saw other people but whenever we were both single we’d fool around.
i met this new girl in college and soon we started dating however the new girl had a condition that i had to totally cut my girl bestf off in order for me and her to date i hesitated at first and me and the new  girl kept going on and off for 6 months but i really like this new girl so i gave in and distanced myself from my girlbestf and even removed her from all social media . 
the main issue is that my girlbestf is moving to london in 2 months and i do want to spend her last few months with her in the country but i also dont want to dissapoint my new girlfriend.
i am currently not in talking terms with my girlbestf and i know she’s extremely pissed but she’s not showing it and acting as if she doesn’t care. "
71,1jwzovh,Not the A-hole,AITA for arguing with my bf bc he couldn’t go to the ER with me?,"My boyfriend had worked from 11 to 4:30 that day, and later that night I started feeling really sick from the antibiotics I was prescribed. I was throwing up, spotting, and I’m currently 6 weeks pregnant. He came upstairs with me for a bit, then went back downstairs to lay down. I asked him to come back up to rub my belly and just be with me because I was in pain. 

He told me to finish studying on Discord, and apparently said he was going to take a nap, though I didn’t hear that part. I rushed to finish my studying because I was feeling worse, and about 13 minutes later I texted him, but got no response. I went downstairs to see he had fallen asleep. Later that night, the vomiting got worse and I ended up having to go to the ER by myself. I tried to wake him, but he wouldn’t get up. While I was in the ER, he FaceTimed me and I updated him. Before I left, I sent him another update—he didn’t respond. When I got home, he gave me a peck on the cheek and went back to bed. I was frustrated and messaged him how I felt. 

He apologized and admitted it was his fault, but said I also should have told him I was going. It was especially sensitive to me because during my two previous pregnancies, which ended due to severe hyperemesis and rapid weight loss, he never came to a single doctor’s visit. 

The next day, he woke up around 1 p.m., and I asked to talk. He told me “not right now” because he had just woken up—but he was on the game. I gave him his ring back, and we started arguing. He said he didn’t have to check on me but did, and that no matter what he does, I always say I feel alone. 

He said I discredit him whenever I’m emotional, but the truth is: I’m carrying our baby, not just mine. Wanting him to be there during moments like that isn’t me making everything about myself—it’s me asking for support in a moment that mattered.

AITA? I honestly want to ask him to move out and go to live with his mom in another state."
72,1jwx89t,Not the A-hole,AITA For Confronting My Coworker Via Text About a Joke He Made About My Girlfriend?,"For reference, my coworker and I have been working with each other for a few years now and ever since we’ve started working with each other it’s been constant jokes that are jabby and good-natured in the end. We’ve even made plans to hang out outside of work and, though they’ve never come through, it shows that both of us consider each other pretty good friends I’d think. However, just about five months ago I started dating my gf, who I love very much, and couldn’t be happier. I put a picture of her as my wallpaper so I can see her whenever I open my phone. Recently, a group of us grabbed lunch and my coworker was sitting next to me. He had never seen my gf before but knew I was in a relationship. When I opened my phone to check a message he said in a jokey tone “woah, who’s that boy?”. When I first heard that, I thought he was trying to make some out-of-color joke about me seeing a guy or something, so I just told him to shut up jokingly and we all continued to eat normally. As we were all leaving, he made another joke after a more feminine guy passed by with short hair, saying “he dude, is that your girlfriend?” 

After that, the benefit of the doubt started to go away and the thought that he was attacking my girl’s appearance started taking place. Though we were in a group, these comments were said between the two of us and I wanted to have a conversation about my boundaries there, but it would seem we’d up quickly back in the group soon after each joke. I knew the rest of the day was going to be spent in a car with him and everyone else; if I wanted to have a conversation with him, I wanted it to be between us and not around a group of other people. We never got to be one-on-one that day. I debated whether I should send a text or wait the three days to have a face-to-face with him. I ended up sending him a text talking about the situation.

I sent him asking exactly what he meant by that comment; if it was a general jokey statement or if he was trying to make my girlfriend the butt of a joke. His response came back a bit defensive and specified it was “just a joke” because of my gf's hair length. I mentioned I don’t want to hear jokes about her, specified I’m not fuming mad or angry so the text conversation is not misconstrued in anyway, and that I understand that lines for boundaries can get blurred after joking for so long and not having any boundaries to begin with. He ended up saying that he didn’t mean anything by it but understands what I was saying and that he won’t mention my girlfriend again. I ended the conversation saying that he’s still my friend and it's only something I wanted to set as a boundary.

I guess my question is AITA for bringing this conversation up two days after the fact? Was I being too sensitive to a joke? I felt something had to be done because I don’t want my girlfriend to be joked about. For reference, I have never made any comments about his wife and my girlfriend doesn’t know about the situation."
73,1jwwwe8,Not the A-hole,AITA For Not Vibing With My Fiance's Friend Group,"Been with my fiance for 4 yrs. In that time I've hung out with this 1 friend group of his a handful of times. Every time I've hung out with them has been awkward. I don't know what to talk to them about. They've all been friends since middle school and I feel like it's a friendship based on history and not so much about having anything in common anymore.

Whenever we hang out with them, even my fiance doesn't say a whole lot to them. They never seem to have any real conversations that I can jump in on. They mostly make weird jokes to each other or talk about things that happened in the past, which is fine, but I obviously can't relate. I feel like I just sit around smiling awkwardly and playing on my phone.

The one friend who is the most social of the group and actually makes an effort to talk to me weirds me out. In the past, he tried to hit on me several times IN FRONT OF my fiance and said some crude things about me TO MY FIANCE. My fiance said he talked to him and told him he was out of line and now they're good. I feel like I've forgiven but not forgot. I don't hold this behavior against him and he has a girlfriend now and seems to have moved on, BUT I feel kind of uncomfortable talking to him knowing that he had a thing for me and I just don't want to start any drama with the group.

My fiance's friend's wife - I find fake. She's all about posting online about how great her life is and how she's so supportive of other women but she's never really made an effort to talk to me or get to know me. She's typically the one other woman in the group but we don't have anything in common and I feel like she's unfriendly. Last time, she made no effort to ask me anything about myself. She knew my fiance and I were engaged and she plans weddings so I thought maybe she'd ask me about mine, but she didn't say anything and only really talked to her other friend there, and I didn't feel included in their conversation. Fiance said his ex didn't like her either.

When I was at a bar with 1 of my friends and their group walked in and saw me but didn't acknowledge me or ask us to join them, my friend commented they seemed unfriendly and rude which stuck with me.

I have social anxiety, but I feel like I get along fine with coworkers, my friends, and some of my fiance's other friends, so it's really just this group where I struggle. I want us to all get along so I feel like part of a group, but it's never happened. I feel like at this point it's not going to.

Last night, I felt so left out, I sat and played on my phone for an hour until I told my fiance I needed to leave for work. He thought I was pissy and I was, even tho he didn't do anything wrong. I told him I was tired of feeling like I don't vibe with the group. I gave them another chance, but I don't want to go out with them anymore because it feels like a waste of time.

Wondering if I'm the AH for just checking out and not wanting to hang out with them anymore or if they're AHs for being cliquey and weird."

I could see a guy in a Silverado flying down the merge lane all the way to the end where I am now at. He starts trying to get over into the tiny space between me and the car in front of me, and I don’t let him. He had a quarter mile of merge lane to slow down and put his blinker on to get in. He ends up on the shoulder blaring his horn at me and flipping me off, but I never gave him any room (I also drive a truck for context). Am I the asshole?"
75,1jwvkzs,Not the A-hole,AITA for standing up for myself after being accused of sharing a classmate's personal info?,"Hi, I’m a 16-year-old girl and I’ve had issues with the same group of classmates since around 6th grade. They’ve never liked me, and over the years they’ve spread rumors, made false accusations, and generally made me feel excluded and uncomfortable.

Recently, one of the girls in the group, let’s call her Rose (14F), told me in class that I “knew what I did.” I was really confused, and then she and her friends claimed I had shared another classmate’s personal information. I had no idea what they were talking about and hadn’t done anything like that, but they were talking about telling adults or getting authorities involved, which made me really anxious.

Later that day, my online friend Sunny (15F), who lives in a different country, messaged me saying she was upset about the situation too. She had been told I was the one who did it—by someone I thought was a friend. She also said some really hurtful things to me.

At that point, I felt overwhelmed and upset. I ended up confronting the group and saying that it wasn’t fair how they were treating me, especially considering that some of the people in their group have also said and done things that weren’t okay in the past. I also told one of them, let’s call him Alex, to stop contacting me and give me space. I blocked him on social media.

Later, Alex reached out again from a new account and apologized. He said he was pressured by his group and his sister, and that he thought I had actually done something wrong. He seemed genuine, but I still feel really hurt and confused about everything.

Now I’m wondering if I went too far by calling them out and cutting them off. Part of me feels guilty, but part of me also feels like I had to finally say something after years of this behavior.

So… AITA?"
76,1jwuwo6,Not the A-hole,AITA for trying to keep both my fronds how had a falling out,"I (20m) have a decently large college friend group. For one reason or another, my dorm has become the de facto hangout place, where I live with two roommates (19m and 20m, in the friend group but not involved in the situation). I also am naturally proactive and like making friends and inviting people to hangout, so people often look to me for plans/ arbiting.

Recently two friends of mine who often hang out in my dorm had a falling out,  Brent(20m) and Cassie(20f). I will not go into depth, but interactions between them have often turned sour. The current situation is that they can't stand each other. Cassie no longer wants to be around Brent ever again and Brent says that if they are together he will ignore her completely. They have tried talking but they are seemingly unable to view each other in good faith.

I would like to remain friends with both, but the problem is hangouts in my dorm. I am trying to remain impartial, and how I have been doing that is having to them ""take turns"" hanging out. When one is in the dorm I tell the other sorry but come back another time. Note: they live in dorms really close by and can hear when the other is in (they are both loud). Just yesterday Brent got upset that I would tell Cassie if he is there or not when she asks, as he views that as taking sides. He got angry and blocked me. AITA for choosing this solution.

I was sooo exhausted on my journey there and back, i just got back last thrusday. I was out with a friend on saturday and he called me up because he said my niece wanted to see me. I told him i cant talk as im out.

I got so pissed off. He has done this in the past.. one time my ex was literally in the hospital dying of cancer when he asked me to go up and visit him and that my ex has his mom who can take care of him, and then complained to mom when i said i couldnt.. i felt so guilty i ended up going for 4 days anyway. 

What really pisses me off is he barely messages to ask me how im doing, how my partner is, what stuff i have been up to.. when i was visiting him last week he expected me to take the week off but he didnt do it himself.

My older brother (31M) is going on a 10-day trip with his girlfriend and asked if I could watch his dog, Tank. The issue is, Tank is a 90-pound pit-lab mix who’s super high energy and honestly kind of a handful. He’s knocked over my niece, chewed up furniture, and he really doesn’t like cats.

I told him I couldn’t do it. First, my lease won’t allow a dog that size, and second, I just brought a new cat home and I’m not about to stress her out or risk anything happening. He said I was being uptight and that “no one checks that stuff anyway.” He even offered to drop off his crate and food like that made it all fine.

When I stuck to my no, he got annoyed and said I was choosing a cat over family. Now our parents are on his side too, saying it’s just for a few days and I should help him out.

I get that it’s inconvenient, but I really don’t feel comfortable risking my lease or my cat’s safety.

79,1jwu2x4,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I move out my apartment and tell my therapist why?,"I (26F) live with my (25m) boyfriend and his friend (23m). 

Recently I found out that my boyfriend’s friend, has been keeping a pet tarantula and two pet snakes in the apartment. This is a pet free apartment. I had already asked the landlords before moving in, if they were allowed, and was told it was denied. No pets equals no animals or arachnids in this apartment. Cool! It was discussed before the lease was signed and I assumed we all agreed to those conditions. 

Fast forward to last night, I found out via coming home from group therapy, to be told by the roomie, that he has a tarantula and snakes in the closet. He had shown me pictures of snakes and spiders he wanted, and I thought they were cool. I have no problems with snakes /spiders. What I have a problem with is the fact I wasn’t told and that we were at risk for violating the lease. 

My boyfriend knew about the spider a week before, citing, the roomie told him to not tell me and he didn’t see it as a big deal cause it’s just a pet spider in a container. But found out about the snakes the same time as me, but once again, the roomie said the landlord “can’t enter the apartment without 24 hour notice and we can hide them before then.” 

I was both devastated, pissed off, and just numb at the whole ordeal. 
To make matters worse. I found out that the dead mice were warmed up in a mug, from the kitchen. Now all the mugs look the same, but the roomie doesn’t wash dishes, and I don’t have faith that they aren’t put in the sink with the rest of the dishes and sometimes thawed food. I’m the only one who cleans the apartment, and well dishes. I put them in the same sink water as again, completely unaware of this till last night. 
I’m extremely worried about cross contamination and I think our butts are lucky no one has gotten extremely ill. 

I’m planning on moving out and I wanted to talk to my therapist first about the whole thing, seeing as I’m in intensive outpatient treatment, and a move and stress would affect my mental health worse. 
My friend pointed out the therapist might report, cause as of now, I’m a vulnerable adult with my mental illnesses, and that is an extreme violation of health and safety. 
So would I be the asshole if I move out and tell my therapist what’s going on? "
80,1jwtyqx,Asshole,WIBTA if we didn't buy extra toys for two uninvited children at a kids b day ??,"So I'm 22 but I have twin siblings that are turning 5. My family consists of them, my mom and my dad. We aren't particularly well off but my mom loves to go all out for party's. she sent RSVP invitations to the kids classmates (10 invitations went out 5 of each of the kids friends) i don't really think names are important here but many parents RSVP'd days to even weeks in advance with the party being this sunday. today however one of the last parents texted my mother informing her not only would the invited kid be attending but she'll be bringing their two  siblings one older and one younger (not sure of the exact ages). I know it's odd that i'm 22 with my only siblings being 5 but that's just how it turned out. i'm currently going through university and that's why i live at home but i help out lots with the house in general . My mom is probably the sweetest person ever and informed the parent that it would be fine that the other kids can come however we already bought all the toys for the loot bags for the children.

The reason this is such an issue is because the kids were supposed to find the items in a safari/jungle adventure type manner as the party progresses. they consist of packs of barbie clothes, pencils, candies, and the ""mini brand"" toys that come with all the small items inside. Those? not exactly cheap. we have put a lot of money into things like decorations, food for all 10 kids and their parents and of course gifts for the kids. we bought all the loot bag things in advance when we could find them on sale so that the quality of the toys were still good but in budget. However this was in the span of months and now they aren't on sale anymore making them more expensive. Should we just cover the cost of two more loot bags like my mother wants as she's so worried about these kids feeling left out or would we be the asshole if she listened to me when i say they it was wrong of the mom to invite 2 more children to a party. let me know 


I want to know that my mother is crazy good at shopping deals and got all these items for a couple cents to a dollar and these items are mostly above 10$ so that's why this is a bit of a headache  "
81,1jwspg9,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my friend I don't want to sleep at her place because of her family's spirituality ?,"Some context:  
I’ve been friends with L for over 10 years (we're both 25F). Her family went through a lot, but L has never been very open about it, she is really reserved in general. What I do know is that her dad passed when she was 16, her brother raised her, her sister left unexpectedly, and she now lives with her mom (\~60) and brother (37). Their main way of coping with everything has been spirituality—tarot, numerology, rituals, etc.

I always felt like her family was pushing it on L, with the way she used to complain about it a lot. Not just about that, her family’s always pressuring her in a way (often criticized + the fact that she does most, if not all of the chores). But the actual subject of our dispute was spirituality itself. I have nothing against it, I just don’t want to participate. The problem with me is : I’ve always struggled to say no. If someone ask me if I want to do something, I’ll say yes to please them, especially if it’s important to them. And of course, I never said to L that I felt uncomfortable about that, to not hurt her..

Here’s what happened:  
When L asked me and a friend to come to her place last week, she asked if we would like to do some tarot readings with only us 3, for fun. When I got there the one reading my cards ended up being her mother, I was not really okay with it anymore, but I couldn’t just say no to her face. By the time her brother showed up to do some numerology with me I was trying to find an excuse to leave.

2 days ago, L was invited to an event where she could advertise her work to potential clients, me and our friend were invited to the event AND to sleep at her place afterward. And I just really didn’t want to, there’s something about her family and place that makes me uncomfortable. 2 choices : be honest with an adult whom I’ve known and supported for +10 years or find some excuse like a child.

Here’s how I see it: spirituality is too important for her family for me to lie to them, fainting interest in what they’re saying while being uncomfortable, but I also lie to my friends who think I’m having a good time.

So I finally sent a message saying that I wasn’t comfortable with spiritual activities—not because of her or her family, but just personally—and that while I was happy to support her at the event, I wouldn’t stay the night. I knew I should’ve said something sooner, I really tried to express it kindly and clearly.

She didn’t take it well.  
She was upset, said I was judging her family without knowing them or their struggles, and even pulled our other friend into it, saying we were talking behind her back (we weren’t). She eventually told us not to come to the event. I still sent a message wishing her luck.

Today she apologized, but also told our friend behind my back that I was too radical, stuck to my opinions, and that I ""ran away"".

I honestly feel awful. I wanted to be honest and set one single boundary and it blew up. I never meant to hurt her, I’m confused and sad that it turned into this AITA?"
82,1jws93d,Not the A-hole,AITA when I call my friend a bad friend?,"Me (27M) and friend (27M), lets call him James. We have known each other bit over a decade and he has been nice guy.

Over the years there has been cases when I visited him in other city, and I had to wait him almost every single time 1 to 2 hours to get pick me up from trainstation. Anoying inconvinience, cous things has been planed in advance, and yet he got stuff to do right that moment when he would have to go pick me up.

Now to problem on this day. We have played videogames before and most times we have played games he had and wanted to play. I was curious that would I like games that he played and have bought two games and played with him. And for comparison, I have suggested some similar but different games he to test with me and some even free games. I can not remember time he would have even tested free game or even to be open for idea to test one. One old free game I had, I suggested to him and he promised many times to test it after he had completed self made mission on game he got me to buy and play with him. After completing that, he didn't want to test game I suggested.

Now I have free game again and asked him to look it up and he hesitates that would he even like it. So, would ITA when I call my friend bad friend over these all and one slight betrayal?

I can explane more on comments if anything here needs clarification."
83,1jwqdzl,Not the A-hole,AITA Mom expecting me to call her every day,"Edited: to finish because I hit send by mistake.
Edit: to include moms age

My mom (80) told me (45f) that I should call her everyday. I told her I would not be doing that. She told me if I can’t do that then don’t bother ever calling her again. I told her I would continue to call and she can choose to answer if she wants to. I currently call my mom about 1x per week. For some background, my mom is and always has been a very controlling and abusive person. She has gone years and years without talking to her children, and the only reason any of us have a relationship with her is because despite the abuse, we continue to try to be there for her in her older age. My father passed away about two years ago and she really doesn’t have any other friends because of how she treats people. After my dad passed away she talked really horribly about him for about a year. 
I call my mom out of obligation and to be honest, just so I don’t feel like an asshole for not talking to my mom at all. Every conversation I have with her is her complaining about other people. It used to be talking really bad about my dad and my siblings. (She speaks badly of me to my siblings too). Now it’s about 2”friends” that have tried to be there for her since my dad’s death. She really hates everyone. I have four other siblings and she only speaks to two of us. One of them she completely disowned about 20 years ago.  I don’t enjoy speaking to my mom. Am I the asshole for refusing to call her once a day and considering lessening that to maybe once every two weeks once per month? "
84,1jwpmh1,Not enough info,AITA for not wating to change how I spell or say a certain word?,"So my partner and I live in the Netherlands, I'm native while he's been learning the language and I've been helping / correcting him where I can. In the Dutch language 'Not' is spelled as 'Niet' but over text I write it as 'Nii' and I say it like so as well.

I don't know where I picked up this quirk but it's just how I write and say the word. My partner expresses frustration at this, calling it a butchering of the language and that it annoys him. I'm trying to understand why but he's having a hard time pinpointing and explaining why it bothers him.

I don't want to be a bad partner and annoy him with something so small, but at the same time I don't want to change how I use a word simply because it annoys him. It feels like he's banning my way of using the word and that, in turn, annoys me.

I know this isn't a massive thing and we're in a super happy, long term relationship. But it's just something that grates at times. AITA for not wanting to switch how I write and say Nii?"
85,1jwpgod,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking fiancé to mute tv for 2 minutes,"It's 8:30am and my son (11) and I are downstairs in the living room. I am working and he is doing his 20 minutes of reading before he heads off to school. A little while later, my fiancé wakes up, comes downstairs and sits on the couch and turns on the tv. I can tell my son is distracted so I politely ask my fiancé if he could mute the tv for just 2 minutes (that's how much time my son had left on his reading timer). For some reason this really annoyed him and he just turned the tv off and said ""fine. I'll just leave the room"" and stormed off to his man cave in the basement to tinker with his 3D printers. 

I should add, he is not my son's father. He came into his life a little over 2 years ago and he lives with us full time. I try to be fair and not favor my son all the time. 

Please tell me...am I wrong for being upset about my fiancé's reaction or should I have told my son to leave the room and go read elsewhere after he had already been sitting there for almost 20 minutes?!"
86,1jwoxb5,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving my Grandma's birthday,"Note : I posted this in another reddit group but I just kinda need to confirm further 😞

I(20) am actually very and I meant extremely sensitive to loud noises, it really does hurt my ears and whenever something noisy comes up (Ex. Multiple people talking loudly or Giant speakers) and whenever that happens I break out crying from the pain in my ears and how much my head hurts. This also started when I was in middle school when the classroom became too loud for me to handle, I literally had to go to the nurse's office after that

So every time I go to a party I would wear headphones (noise cancelling headphones), it's very calming but I would also have a blast trying to have fun for the one having the birthday party to not burden them.

So when my Grandma is going to turn 70, obviously I was extremely happy for her. She's turning old but she is the sweetest grandma you could ever want, always understanding and kind. So I packed up my headphones in my bag but my Mother (46) stopped me saying I can't wear my headphones.

Curious I asked her why so she explained how this is my Grandma's birthday and that I shouldn't embarrass myself by wearing those headphones to a birthday party. I already told her I'm sensitive to noises but she wouldn't budge and told me to not wear them or else I was in big trouble and she even snatched it away from me. (I already told her before I don't like loud noises but she called me a drama queen and to toughen it up)

So when I went to the party, and It was extremely loud as I feared. Giant speakers playing loud music is my worst nightmare. I had to cover my ears with my hands because it's hurting my head and my ears felt like it's going to burst out any minute but I had to endure it. So I excused myself to the bathroom to calm myself down for a moment.

When I got there I saw my grandma washing her hands, she looked at me and smiled giving me a big hug saying how much she missed me. When she looked at me again I looked like I was about to cry and asked me what was wrong. I didn't wanted to ruin her birthday and her one special day so I said it was nothing.

She knew I was lying and told me to tell her it's not going to upset her and it's ok to tell even if it's her birthday she told me she wanted everyone to be happy being here. In an instant I told her my headphones were taken away and how the noises were so loud that it hurts. She smiled and gave me permission to leave the party. I looked sad, I didn't want to miss her day because of this but she insisted I can leave and that I need to take care of myself.

I gave her a hug and told her happy birthday again and that I'm sorry for the trouble and I left. My Mom was fuming when she heard I left, she kept calling me saying I was such a drama queen for leaving and that I'm an embarrassment to the family. I know it was rude of me for leaving the party without giving a heads up with the others first and maybe I caused a scene for that secret breakdown. So AITA?"
87,1jwofp9,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if i told my friend she cannot bring her boyfriend to my house to hang out?,"My (20F) friend (20F) has been in a relationship with this guy for a year now.  I invited her to hang out at my house with a few other girls, and at the last minute she asks me to bring her boyfriend. She knows its supposed to be a girl’s day, so she offers to have him sit in the car while we hang out.. i don’t feel comfortable having him sit and wait while we are doing our thing, its rude not to invite him in, but also i dont feel comfortable inviting him in? I am very particular about who comes in my place, and i havent been around him long enough to do that. And the things i do hear about him aren’t great.

From what she’s shared with me, their relationship isn’t the healthiest and seems pretty codependent. She is almost always with him, or on the phone with him, which part of me understands because her boyfriend is a big part of her life. But they are constantly in some sort of major fight or conflict. I dont see my friend very often, but when I do, we are almost always talking about her issues in their relationship. I don’t think either are inherently bad people, I just want to spend time with my friend without the tension that they might argue. Leaving him in the car feels pretty assholish too though. Idk, what do you guys think? "
88,1jwo5g9,Not the A-hole,AITA for ignoring a baby on the train?,"I was on the train yesterday travelling up to university as I had an important exam. I was super stressed out just trying to do my flashcards on my phone.

I was sitting at a four-seater (really quiet train) when this woman with a large buggy sits right across from me, effectively shutting me in. I thought it was weird because she knew I would have no space if she sat there. Obviously, I had practically no space but only had 30 minutes of my journey left so I just smiled at the toddler and kept doing my flashcards. 

Here’s where I may be the asshole. The toddler kept moving about on the seats and screaming when I was just trying to focus. I even had my earphones in to try and block the noise so I could study. I, without even thinking about it, let out a sigh. I didn’t even mean it. The mum looked at me and asked if I was bothering her. I said no, I’m just trying to focus. She then said I was strange for not even entertaining her child for the journey. I didn’t even say hello to him or anything. I could have gave her a break. 

I was shocked by this because why am I, a stranger, meant to entertain your child? Just because you sat right next to me and blocked me in on a quiet train? It was so weird of her. I just nodded and went back to what I was doing because I had other things on my mind.

AITA? "
89,1jwnsuz,Asshole,"AITA if my boyfriend made a meal and asked me how it was and I said ""fine""","So my boyfriend made chicken breast with some white rice, a salad with garlic and we had some pickles and beetroot on the side (from jars) and we sit down and he says: how is it? And I said fine, there's nothing special, everything tastes as it should. And he got upset and said he added extra garlic in the lettuce and soy sauce on the breast ( we both said we couldn't taste that) and I said I am not used to making comments about food like he is in his family. When we eat with his mother everyone has to say something along the lines of ""how delicious... this is so tasty... yumm""... at every meal. 

And in my family we probably find that behaviour a bit fake. We just sit down and talk about other things and if there was something new in the food then that would be a normal question to ask how it was... So he got really upset because I should've just said, it's great or it's good instead of a normal and not very enthusiastic.. ""it's fine, everything tastes as it should."" 

And he proceeded to pick his plate up and left to eat in the office. I don't feel like partaking in a family tradition I don't feel is natural... I feel like I am forced to say something I don't care about it or don't believe in.. it's chicken breast and white rice... I mean, AITA for not making a bigger deal out of a simple meal? Is he overreacting or should I just be fake and oblige and say ""it's really tasty... "" every single fking meal...."
90,1jwmvov,Not the A-hole,AITA if I tell my friends to rent a car?,"A few of my friends want to vacation in my state in September, and I offered them a place to stay as well as my annual companion ticket to help them both fly here for cheaper. Originally, I mentioned that if they wanted to use my car while they were here they could… but now the thought of that is giving me immense anxiety. It’s a great and reliable car, and even though it’s old it’s genuinely my most prized possession. It’s the one thing I own outright. If something broke on it or an accident happened while they were out driving it I don’t think our friendship would be the same. Given my reflection on that, I suggested that they look into rental cars today, and they acted very annoyed. When I called them on it, they said they planned their whole trip around using my car. Am I the Asshole? 

EDIT: I want to add context: no financial commitments have been made to their trip. The airline tickets have not been bought, no activities have been paid for, nothing is set in stone. We are in the process of planning their trip without full commitment to it. "
91,1jwmqgt,Not the A-hole,AITA: my bf's godson is driving me crazy,"My bf (38) is very close with his 11 yo, almost 12 yo godson, who lives in a small town around 2 hours away and regularly visits for several days at a time. My BF always hosted his godson when he lived alone. He's a generally fine, well behaved kid. I am the first girlfriend my bf has ever lived with and it's serious between us, and we've lived together the last year and a half. His godson has stayed with us multiple times and recently I've found the experience very frustrating.

When he comes, my bf becomes extremely indulgent. It's by my bf's own admission, too: ""he has strict parents at home, so when he comes i try to make it his theme park."" His godson's mom (basically for all purposes my bf's older sister) seems pretty reasonable to me--limit screen time, ensure he completes homework, keep him busy with activities that don't include screen time, make sure he doesn't eat crap all the time. And she regularly makes requests for those boundaries to be respected and my bf generally ignores them. I find that aspect a little inappropriate. When there's a conflict (last visit godson blew off a big school project and she was really pissed), my bf seems to always take his godson's side, even though he's a child. I don't feel comfortable being part of what feels like undermining his parents, especially his mom. I can only imagine how annoying it must be if godson goes home and starts pushing back against his mom. He's entering puberty and it's already starting to happen.

This recently was an issue where he stayed with us for 5 days. They played Fortnite almost the entire time. My BF said he would put some ground rules down like ""only 90 minutes per day,"" which was blown through by early morning followed by more hours in the afternoon and evening. 

It also ends up being that I end up being a kind of caretaker. I enjoy cooking and like to make healthy meals for myself. It ends up meaning that if I cook, I cook for all of us. So i'm knocking on the door and asking if The Boys Are Hungry? I hate it.

I don't like video games because it means i can't have a conversation with either of them, i barely get greeted.

After his godson left I asked my bf if next time we could try and treat our home more like a shared space. I asked for actual implementation of screen time limits (suggested 2.5 hours per day, like 1.5 hours in the am then an hour in the evening), a prioritization of creative activities that either involve going to places in our very cool city or doing more quiet non-screen activities at home. It did not go well. My bf became defensive, quiet, angry, and tried to suggest that these requests are not fair. The whole conversation was a nightmare.

I just don't understand why my bf can't just be the adult in the room? What are the implications of this for us and any kids we have? Am i being gaslit here about my request, which feels very forgiving and compromising already? Do i have a right at all to be bothered by any of this?"
92,1jwmigu,Asshole,AITA for not letting my girlfriend fart in front of me,"My girlfriend (20 F) and I (19 F) have been dating for 8 months. Early on, I made a joke about being too grossed out by farts and pooping, and told her to never do it in front of me (or joke about it). As time went on, she didn't, and it was never an issue.
Tonight, the conversation came up and I told her although I know it's a human function, it makes me feel dirty and uncomfortable. She told me holding them in hurts, and read farting in front of your significant other is a sign of a healthy relationship.

Although I'm sure that works for others, I feel that all relationships are different and if it's something I struggle with, it should be something to compromise about- not just let it rip. I suggested if she has to, she goes to the bathroom and comes back.
For context, I tend to be hyper aware about cleanliness (shower multiple times/day, no outside clothes on the bed, anti chewing nails, etc).

Recently it's been getting more severe, and normal things are becoming more and more bothersome for me. My brain won't stop the nagging about the air, my bed, my car, whatever it is- being contaminated, and I'm not sure how to make it stop. We both know it's most likely a problem I should look into- but I haven't yet.

We're very comfortable around each other, and will let pretty much anything slide when we're together-Ijust personally need this boundary.
Am I the Asshole for expecting my gf to hold/nol talk about it in front of me for the time being?"
93,1jwmdiv,Not the A-hole,AITA for wanting a birthday cake that my mum doesn't like?,"Title, I had my birthday yesterday and I really wanted a carrot cake but my mum doesn't like carrot cake, I didn't have a big birthday or anything it was just me and mum and we didn't even really celebrate because I've never celebrated my birthday as this big day, the extent of the ""celebration"" was she got me a gift in the morning, I went to work, came home, she cooked me dinner and then gave me the cake.

I really like carrot cake and I never really buy it for myself and I feel like my birthday is the one day a year that should be about me but now today my mum is saying that I was selfish for wanting a carrot cake because I should have wanted to get a cake I could share with her. But I live with her so if I ever buy a cake any other time of the year I share it with her, and if she really is so upset about the cake she could've gotten a second cake that she likes or a cupcake or something (it's not like we were sitting together and I was the only one eating cake, I ate it in my room by myself).

94,1jwln5h,Not the A-hole,AITA for not showing up to the school volleyball tournament I was registered for without my consent?,"Good morning.

I attend a high school where student-organized sports tournaments are a recurring tradition.
A few weeks ago, one of my friends took the liberty of registering a volleyball team, enlisting several of our classmates – including myself.
The catch? I never actually agreed to participate.

I’m not particularly athletic, don’t play volleyball, and have precisely zero interest in pretending otherwise.
This was obviously common knowledge.
I was added to the roster regardless, allegedly as “coach” — of course this was more symbolic than functional.
Everyone, including el capitano, knew I wouldn’t be playing.

Then, shortly before the event, the very mastermind behind this entire endeavor switched teams and joined the school's pros.
This triggered a cascade of others backing out as well, with most of them declaring that they wouldn’t attend school the day of the tourney.
Thus, the consensus was that the team had effectively dissolved – problem seemingly fixed.

I stayed home since I was confident in this collective withdrawal.
My mum knew I wouldn’t be in school that day (I was officially excused), but she wasn’t aware I had ever been listed as a player in the first place.
I figured no one would show any interest, since the team seemed defunct anyway.

Now the spicy part and a plot twist: the same people who had sworn off attending showed up after all.

Even worse, those few who had indeed remained committed from the beginning had mentally prepared for a cancelled match — and are now unexpectedly being pushed onto the court, unprepared and heavily betrayed.

As for me, I didn’t show up. I wasn’t needed, I wasn’t willing, and honestly, I didn’t want to spend the day justifying a role I never signed up for or agreed to taking.
But now there’s a whiff of passive-aggressive disappointment from the student organizers, like I somehow violated an unwritten social contract by not magically appearing for a team that was supposed to be obsolete the day before.

TLDR: Got signed up without consent for a school volleyball tournament. The team captain bailed, others followed — or so I thought.
I stayed home with an excuse note, assuming the team was done.
Turns out they went anyway. Now I’m getting side-eyes for not showing. AITA?

95,1jwld98,Not the A-hole,AITA for ignoring my sister for months because of her behavior and decision-making?,"So I(22f) and my older sister(26f) were pretty close ever since I was on hs and her being in college. We both transfer school and move in with our grandparents (father side). were literally bff who talks about EVERYTHING.(1) As years goes by, I noticed how much she becomes rude to other people on her social media. Saying things like “she doesn’t have to post that”, “she can’t even dance properly”, “if I were her/him I wouldn’t do that.”Knowing her I know she has a lot of insecurities and I feel like itmight be the reason she was being rude to some people,it shows how much it reflects on her. I do judge people, I mean we all do. But her comments are sometimes out of hand. She sometimes doesn’t like my reaction, or rolled her eyes on me,I don’t tolerate her behaviour. When she noticed I often disagree with her, she lessen up asking my opinion. She rarely talks about her relationship daily rants as well because I go neutral when I know the situation she talks about was sometimes her fault. She always shrugged it off that I should be on her side. I am but, it’s just that most of the time she’s in the wrong side.  
  
(2) She used my things especially clothes WITHOUT her asking permission. And whenever I said no she always tell me the things she had done for me like she also let me borrow her stuff that I ASK PERMISSION for. So in the end I let her borrow it out of guilt that. She pic in her socials and when I confronted her she would say she forgot to ask me.  But it happens so often that I begun to always say No to her request.  
  
Another year, parents got divorced, we found out dad has a mistress. At that year, my mom was also staying with us but decided to move out.The divorce affected me so much and my siblings. This somehow leads my older sister to unnecessary paths.(3) She began to be toxic with her relationships, which leads to her cheating. Around that time, she doesn’t live with us and stays with her bf but visits us. There were several things she would do that I won’t be sharing but it build a wall  of disappointment knowing that she is the oldest sister and should be getting her life together. Because of this I’ve become more distant to her.  
  
Now this would be the time that I might be the A, my older sister wants to borrow my Halloween mask that is very sentimental to me. I said, no. She said she already promised to her friend that she’s letting him borrow MY mask even without asking me first. I said no. Like I said, I’m setting boundaries. She complained it to my mom. They tried to pursuit me to let her borrow it. Still I said no. I went to school, returned home and my mask is nowhere to be find. I messaged her about disrespecting me. I blocked her. And gave her the silent treatment whenever she visits. Months passed. Although there’s still guilt that I shouldn’t have said that to her because aside from the reason that she’s my oldest sister, My mom also text me and said I should make it up to my sister So, Am I the A?"
96,1jwl9xw,Not the A-hole,AITA for not eating food made for me on a date because I’m picky?,"I (24F) am a single mum of an 8 year old. I was in a bad relationship as a teen, which led to me being pregnant. I haven’t exactly dated since, maybe been out on a few dates.

My daughter has a condition called ARFID. It means she has a very restricted diet, and it is very much connected to her ASD. I don’t force her to eat certain things that are her “unsafe foods.”

Since her diagnosis, I’ve been quite sure I might have it too, but I cook for us both and am self sufficient, so it doesn’t bother me day to day enough to think about it.

Anyway, about a month ago I went on a date, to which we went out to dinner, and it was amazing. He was so open to meeting my daughter in the future and being a family man. I only do serious relationships, so yes this is stuff that was discussed on the first date lol.

The second date was a week ago. I went over to his place (not for anything weird, just to watch a movie.) He then made dinner. Don’t get me wrong, it looked amazing, but I felt awful telling him I actually couldn’t eat it. Usually if something is an unsafe food for me (such as melted cheese, vinegar) I’ll still choke it down to be polite, and just vomit and cry later. But he had put my one hard no in there. Mayo. I hate it, but more importantly I’m actually just allergic to eggs. Pretty severely. He knew this, as I told him on the first date. He was cool with this on the date.

Once he gave me the food, I apologised so much, but I couldn’t eat it. He replied with, “Once we get you past this mayo thing -my daughter’s name- can get over her crap too.” I was pretty mad about that comment, and snapped back that i’m not eating his gross food and to not talk about my daughter like that. He apologised instantly, saying that’s not what he meant and that it was a stupidly rude joke. I said I was sorry for calling his food gross, it actually looked really good. We ordered some Maccas and I went home soon after. He seemed okay.

About an hour later, I texted him that I had a lot of fun and sorry about the situation. He said “It’s fine, just didn’t have to be such a dick about it.” I was confused, we went home happy. I apologised some more, and he brought back up me saying it was gross and refusing to eat it. He was completely ignoring the allergy part of it and saying “You really need to get over this, Cass. It’s childish and it’s not the way you raise a kid.” things like that. I know being picky is annoying, but I don’t feel like I did anything too wrong. 

Am I the asshole?"
97,1jwkqrm,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my boyfriend to better his health,"My boyfriend is a vaper and smokes indoors pretty much 24/7. We are both 28 and he’s been smoking since he was 21. I’m worried about his health as he doesn’t look after himself with not only smoking but I’d say other aspects too. I have asked him numerous times about cutting down and that it’s bad for him but he doesn’t listen.

Other aspects re his health include the fact he has Gout but does very little to stop Gout attacks, and has medication he could be on but does not book to get this sorted with the GP. Gout is crippling and painful for him when it comes on, but then day to day does nothing to stop it so I get confused by this. I’m very much a Type A person who sorts things ASAP! 

I love him so much but he is quite lazy and he admits that too. So I put this down to that. I just don’t know how to encourage him as he does not sort things himself. 

I have learnt to leave things with him as he gets pretty defensive and an argument usually results with him calling me “controlling” and “naggy”. (Although I genuinely raise these issues rarely as I can’t be bothered with his reactions). 

AITA for wanting him to look after himself more and asking him to stop vaping and go to the GP for his gout? He makes me feel like I am!! But I just genuinely want him to be healthy so we can have a long healthy life together. "
98,1jwjyvh,Not the A-hole,AITA for not washing my bf's lunchboxes?,"Hi so for context we've been living together for almost a year, we're 21&22.
After I finished school I didn't have a stable job yet and was a 'stay at home gf' so I did all the cooking and cleaning, picked up after him, planned groceries for the week etc etc while he payed for expenses. (we don't pay rent, and I also contributed a significant amount to buying groceries) 
Finally I got an offer, I'm about to start working and I just finished my trial period.

So now my problem is, he used to just leave his food containers I packed for him last night, laying around in the room, and I'd just wash them when I found them. However this quickly made me feel disrespected, made me feel like his maid, like he literally doesn't have to do ANYTHING, and yet he just leaves it wherever on the floor and can't even think of me for a second. He also had a tendency to forget it in his car or smth and when they finally turned up the inside of it had rotten food obviously. 
So I got fed up, I told him he has to put it next to the sink if he wants me to wash them. This worked for a while, then it started again. Had to dump some containers in the thrash because they were just so disgusting. 

Currently there's a plastic bag looking at me which has a few used lunch boxes in it from 2-3 days ago and I just don't wanna do them.. The day before yesterday night I told him we're running out of food boxes. Then yesterday when I was already at work he texted me ""oh I forgot to tell you there are some boxes in our room in a plastic bag"". I told him well I'm already at work. I worked from 4pm to 11pm so I hoped he'd at least put them in the kitchen when he gets home at 5pm yet he didn't. Now I just don't wanna touch them. 
When there's a box somewhere which has been there for a few days he usually also mocks me like ""hey you've been ignoring these"" and I feel like if he comes home and sees its still there he won't do it he'll just say he told me it's there and I ignored it. 
 like no sir I just don't wanna have to remember your lunch boxes for you and literally go around search for them and then clean up rotten food. 

AITA for not wanting to wash it? "
99,1jwjsf5,Not the A-hole,AITA for saying it's unfair to destroy my stuff when my grandma can't find her own wallet in her room?,"For context this happened literally tonight, like I(18) was in bed watching TV when my grandma(75) called me to her room and told me she couldn't find her wallet. I asked her if she checked in her nightstand because it was around that area, she said she did. All she did was open and shut the nightstand.  Didn't move things around or nothing. Then she starts saying that she should have my mom take apart my room to find it. 

A few weeks ago I got into trouble for 'stealing' my grandma's earbuds, I didn't steal them I just took them but didn't ask, my older cousin does this all the time and even uses it in front of them. So ever since that issue it's 'who else's stuff did you steal and put in your room' whenever something goes missing. 

But back onto tonight I repeatedly say I don't have the wallet, it's somewhere in your room, you're not gonna find it in my room because I didn't take it. Then she makes me get all my beauty stuff that I BOUGHT with the little money I get because I only work like 3 days a week for 4 hours(I also bought my older cousin some stuff because she lives in another state) and I say that's not fair because I didn't take the wallet so I shouldn't give her my stuff. This goes on for several minutes, and before I know it she threatens to destroy all my stuff if she can't find the damn wallet. And I'm definitely fed up at this point because I DO NOT HAVE IT. I just get an attitude and say that that's not fair at all because I didn't take it and it's in her room and she misplaced it somewhere because we all literally misplace our stuff all the time. I yelled at her saying it wasn't fair at all and she threatened me back saying to watch myself before kicking me out, and nearly hitting me with the door. I'm considering telling my older cousin because my parents always seem to be more willing to her then to me so maybe she can talk some sense into her?

She kicked me out of her room and I literally have some limited edition makeup and stuff that my job sold and all together my makeup is at least $50. AITA? 

Update- It's the next day and she's determined to throw away my things, even some I got for my cousin when she comes to visit. I tried to reason with her saying to just wait a few days and look for it then because it happens to all of us when we misplace something and look for it, only to find it a few days later somewhere else. There's no point in talking to a brick wall about it, so my stuff is just gonna get thrown away and I have to start all over again just like my sketchbook. I do appreciate the advice, and while I think something is up with her memory since she got COVID last year I can't express it because she'd just shut me down, and the doctors aren't much help either, just lying and saying she's fine when it's obvious she isn't 

UPDATE- She found it, but neither of us remember her putting it where she found it, she found it near her dresser by an old gift"
100,1jwjhai,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I evicted my renter who has had a lot of bad luck/money troubles?,"
I (36F) have a renter (34M) who's been living in a room in my house for 5 years. It was originally meant to be a temporary arrangement at the beginning of 2020 when he needed a place to live and we had an extra room we didn’t really use, but he's stayed much longer than expected. He’s a good renter mostly, quiet and keeps to himself. During these 5 years, my family has grown from 2 to 4 children, and I now work from home using part of my teenager's bedroom as an office.

Some context about my renter: He's a traveling construction worker with a difficult background (former foster kid with a record). He's often away for 2-3 months at a time for work and has his dog with him when he travels. He pays $650 per month for the room.

The situation has become complicated for a few reasons:

- He recently was in a minor car accident and is paying for repairs out-of-pocket 
- He doesn't have a bank account due to mistrust of banking systems (honestly, valid) 
-but, because he won’t get a bank account he uses expensive services like Walmart money transfer etc to send money (it’s really expensive and hard to not have a bank account in this country) which limits is options for other housing 
- Finding new housing might be challenging for him given his background
- (less relevant) He's currently ~4 months behind on rent but I’m not pushing it and am not planning to ask for payment if he leaves. 

I genuinely need the space for my family—my work situation isn't ideal, and my kids are cramped. Him not paying but also not being here has made the need for the space pretty glaring and I don’t really rely on the money coming from the rent. 

At the same time, I recognize that asking him to leave will put him in a difficult position, especially in these dark times. I’m willing to help him store his things and look for a new space. I also feel that this might not be the best use of his money (he’s in town for a couple of weeks at a time between jobs—he could potentially just rent a short term place when he’s here instead of paying for a place he doesn’t inhabit much. Idk I’m not trying to run his life.) 

AITA if I ask him to move out? "
101,1jwj41q,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my friend to elaborate?,"So I (15f) and my friend (16m) have been going through a rough patch recently, so I'm here to make sure I'm not biased because of that. I was talking about how I took a personality test (Briggs Myers, I got INFJ) and how the results made so much sense for my logical decision making based on external factors while being a very introspective, emotional person. He said he disagreed. I asked to which, he said to the logical decision making. Because I wanted to hear his perspective and was intrigued, I asked ""how so?"" And he said ""will not say why"". We then went back and forth for a while and I said ""I understand that you don't want to share your opinion but by saying you have an opinion on me and just leaving it at that leads me into overthinking a lot and I feel like I’m doing something really wrong, which I immediately want to fix."" I obviously know that's emotional input, which he pointed out, but I've also opened up about past trauma which causes that. What he pointed out was ""that, in turn, affects your logic and rationale, don't you agree?"" After a little more back and forth, I said ""My point to you is that my individual needs is going to effect how friendships function for me. I feel like you are refusing to acknowledge that. I am trying to express my needs, but I feel you are ignoring them by saying “we all have needs” which is of course true, but not what is needed for a healthy friendship. I ask you to respect my needs, as I will respect yours"" which he said ""your needs being you needing to hear my opinion."" I know he has a point, in that he doesn't have to share his opinion and that me asking to hear it is an overtly emotional action. However, because I've opened up to him, which is really hard for me, I feel like him bringing up his opinion unwarranted and then not elaborating when he knows it is causing me distress is inconsiderate. So, AITA?

TLDR: After I took a personality test and was talking about it with my friend, he said he didn't think that I made decisions logically (I didn't ask a question to prompt this). I asked him to elaborate, but he refused. AITA?"
102,1jwj1nu,Not the A-hole,"AITA for expecting my friend to cover both the trip to and from the airport, not just one way?","HELP I NEED Y’ALL’S OPINION??
Okay so here’s the deal. I live in a colleg dorm, and so does my friend. The holidays just ended, so I’m back at the dorms, but my friend hasn’t returned yet because they’re still out of state.  

This friend calls me asking if I can pick them up from the airport (I have a car. Slay). The issue is, the airport is about 20km from our campus. Obviously, my friend would need to pay for gas, right?  

Now here’s my question: how much distance should they be paying for?  

Here’s how I see it:  
I have to drive from the college to the airport (20km), and then from the airport back to the college (another 20km). So in total, I’m driving 40km to help this friend. So in my head, they should be paying for gas for 40km, because that’s how far I have to drive to help them, right??  

But when I explained this to my friend, they said they were only expecting to pay for 20km (the airport to uni part). Like... what???  

This isn’t the first time this has happened either. A few months ago, I helped another friend and they also thought they only needed to pay for 20km.  

So now I’m wondering — am I charging too much? Am I being unreasonable??  
Like… this isn’t teleportation — I have to drive there AND back. I don’t just magically appear at the airport and start the journey from there. I’m using MY car, MY gas, and MY time for the whole trip.  

So am I wrong in expecting my friend to cover the gas for the full 40km? cause like my broke ahh definitely cant ""sponsor” my friend's airport pickup.  

AITA???"
103,1jwiwyz,Not the A-hole,AITA For not working two jobs?,"Me and my significant other recently got married and are living in an apartment together, i have an ok job that’s has great benefits but i usually only work 32-36 hours a week. I have recently been promoted yet she wants me to get a second job to supplement the hours for not working a full time 40 hour a week job. i make about 43K after taxes. We have no debt besides my significant others school debt to pay off, and can do so in 2 years of less easily. We are both financially responsible and have money saved for emergency fund (approximately 5-6 months worth of living expenses). we are not financially struggling and I don’t think I will mentally be ok with stressing about two jobs. If we were financially struggling i would spring to a job that could support us but i don’t see that as a need now. Yet my S/o calls me lazy and not ambitious for not wanting to find a second job. My parents love us and offer to let us move in and save more money from rent for a year or two to help save up for a house and she is still really pushing the idea of a second job. AITA?"
104,1jwimu5,Not the A-hole,AITA for finishing games before addressing my partner?,"I [M23] work at a full time call center job working >40 hours a week on average, while my partner [22nb] works mostly part time jobs and picks up what hours they can. They're home most other times throughout the week unless they go over to a friend's house. Gaming is a hobby I do at home to unwind. I do other things occasionally, Magic, Gundam, Legos, but most of the time, I like to play games at home. 

My partner expressed to me that I have an addiction to games when I was in a ranked game of League and told them that I would listen to them when I was done. At the time they were going through a depressive episode and needed to talk to someone. I offered to be a listening ear but would have been focusing more on the game. 

I took some time to reflect afterwards and realized I should cut games that would take large spans of time out of my rotation. 

Nowadays I play Magic Arena or Hearthstone, which usually have game times span 10-20 minutes on average. I'll occasionally play genshin or minecraft, but never really get the urge to play longer than an hour of those

The problem lies here, my partner will come into my room with little to no advance warning, wanting my attention in regards to a situation their dealing with or some kind of pain they're experiencing. I've expressed to them several times that when they come in, I may be doing something, but I just need 5-10 minutes to finish up whatever it is, and they can have my full attention. 

They say that I'm letting video games control my life and can't prioritize what should be my number 1 priority. My point of conflict is that in these situations, often times there is little to nothing I can do in the moment, or it's something insignificant that it is not actually an ""emergency"" and can wait 5-10 minutes for me to finish what I was doing before they ask me.

Am I being too focused on games to the point I'm ignoring my partner or should they be respecting my request to finish what I'm doing before I focus on them?

Tl:dr I want to finish my game before I focus on my partner, they want me to drop whatever I'm doing as soon as they come in needing something"
105,1jwiink,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling a family friend he’s banned from my wedding?,"Me (19) and my boyfriend (23) have gotten engaged and have been planning our wedding. We’re very excited and have tried involving both families in the process as much as possible as we both come from big families who are very sentimental.

In our culture, the bride and grooms parents are given the opportunity to choose a handful of their own friends to attend, friends who were there for them when we were growing up (who saw milestones, helped with school, babysat) to essentially just see the wedding as a kind of “full circle moment” And thank you for the input in our lives. 

now the fight started when my mom mentioned she invited some longtime friends. I frowned and told her directly I don’t want them at my wedding. She already had a group of close friends who have been highly involved in both our lives there, could we not just leave this couple out? She got upset and asked me why.

I explained that a few years ago the husband was having a conversation with my father about adoption and step fathers. I was standing with him ( I was probably 12 at the time. ) and he told my dad. 

“I don’t understand how anyone could look after another man’s child or love them as much as their own. They’re just lying. I would never look after a kid that isn’t my own or love them as much as my own sons.”

Now- it’s probably worth mentioning, my dad is my adoptive father. My biological father passed away when I was 2 and my step dad married my mother when I was 5. He’s always been “daddy”. no strings, no titles, no feeling like we weren’t blood. We were family. My dad can also not have biological children, so in his eyes, I was his daughter.

My dad was taken aback at the statement and kind of stepped away. The friend realised he had made a mistake and started brushing it off.

My parents are aware that since then I haven’t liked this guy, so why is it such a big issue that I don’t want him at my wedding? A place where I’m inviting the closest people to me and who hopefully won’t make me cringe when I look at wedding photos. 

I relented after constant requests and told her the wife and the kids are welcome to come since I used to babysit them, but if this guy cannot stay at a far table he can’t come. She huffed and told me what was the point of inviting them if they didn’t sit at her table.
I told my mother I’m not paying for heads I don’t like and she called me unreasonable.
We currently are snappy with each other and she keeps trying to bring up the topic.

Am I the asshole?"

I check the GC to see what other people got and 3 people texted they got high A’s but they used chatgpt. i asked how since our exams are online but use a local down browser and webcam. they said that they just have a different device on the side and the professor thinks there writing down their work.

108,1jwgzeb,Not the A-hole,AITA for not going over to say hello to my friend,"My (28F) friend Mandy (29F) and I have been v.close friends for years. She lives far away but it’s never stopped us being close, we shared every detail of our lives and supported each other through life’s challenges.

But for last 2 years Mandy hasn’t been engaging in same way, she’d often read messages and send just an emoji or nothing, and hardly ever message or call back. I talked to her about it so many times and she’d keep saying she’s busy, tired, or a very specific reason that’s only relevant for a week like “I’m just so busy organising this dinner for weekend”. I visited, called, messaged and sent gifts to act supportive incase she was going through something. 

This went on for 2 years coming up to now. Of course I get it that the relationship changed for her, and anything she told me was an excuse to soften the blow. So I backed off and only went off her energy, if she wanted to chat I did, otherwise I left her to it. And so very long periods would pass until she’d eventually message saying “Hello? Where are you lost these days?” and I’d say each time I’m still here and just don’t message much because she doesn’t. Each time she’d gloss over it with more excuses “I’m just soo busy with clearing out garage”.  

One of things she also started doing was coming to my town and not telling me, spending time with others but not even telling me unless she needed something like finding out where a place is. This really hurt. But again she’d keep trying to keep the illusion everything was normal.

I accepted the friendship was dead and she was just an acquaintance now. 

Fast forward to this week and I saw on social media she was in town. At start of week she did the weird thing of messaging me saying the whole “Hello? Where are you these days?!” and I briefly chatted with her, she made no mention of coming here then next day I see she’s here staying at someone’s house. 

Then yesterday I see her at a wedding it turned out we were both invited to. I felt so strange seeing her, the idea of me going over to say hello felt weird and pitiful so I just didn’t do anything. I wasn’t ignoring her, but I didn’t make effort to go over.

When wedding was nearly over Mandy came over saying I ignored her, didn’t even come greet her and acted like I didn’t know her. I felt so weary that I just sighed and finally said she hadn’t been my friend for a long time now so why would I come over. She got angry saying “Is this just because I’m busy and can’t talk to you much?” and that I was being horrible and rude. She got in a huff acting like I’ve betrayed her and isn’t talking to me now..not that that feels any different.

She told couple of mutual friends her angle and they immediately started saying people are busy and can’t stay in touch. I get that, I have friends where we don’t keep in touch regularly but the friendship remains the same when we see each other as the conversations are meaningful and we actually catch up on each others life."

I expressed I couldn’t stay both nights cause I couldn’t get the second night off from work and had a medical procedure Monday which meant I had to start prepping for said procedure Saturday night .  Another  groomsman couldn’t make it the second night either. Anyways we all meet, go out to an insanely delicious steak dinner.  We covered all the grooms expenses.  Kid didn’t pay a dime.  While looking my over the bill after a few drinks at dinner I did mention to another groomsman that it was a bit more that I thought but obviously it’s no issue paying.  Groom was annoyed I didn’t gamble much cause I’m trying to pay off an 80k renovation and at one point I said “ monies tight, don’t wanna go too broke, again this was all in good fun after a few drinks. ”Also the final hotel bill was shared in a group text, we told the groom this doesn’t apply to you, just the rest of the group and what was owed.  Well today we both got a huge passive aggressive text from groom.  Stating he was appalled the bill was shared with him and the expectation was for him to pay it.  We stated several times it wasn’t.  He then said how dare we make a comment about how expensive dinner was. We’ve known this kid since middle school and we’re all in his mid thirties.  He then got mad at me specifically for not moving around my appts which are harder to book that a normal Dr appts,  and for not having enough money to go all out at the casino.

110,1jwg8j4,Not the A-hole,AITA For Recording My Boyfriend Drunk,"Am I the asshole? I (24F) just broke up with my boyfriend (25M). It all started today, so what happened was that earlier in the day, my now ex boyfriend had asked me did I want to get drunk and play video games with him after I woke up and I said that I would. We ended up not doing that instead we argued for a lot of today. Mostly because I didn’t do what I said we were going to do. He had work later today but when we decided to let things go and rest he wasn’t getting up. He was still drunk and I had a lot of trouble waking him up. So I decided that I needed evidence of this for later just in case he tried to say I didn’t wake him up. I recorded him several times while I tried to wake him up. His boss also called and I asked if he wanted me to pick up the phone and he said yes. But then he got mad and said no. When he finally woke up and I told him he said I shouldn’t have been recording him drunk because he never would’ve done that to me. He stated that I was being petty and not actually trying to wake him up and that I didn’t actually care if he got to work on time. I will admit I blew up and said ‘ok fine since you want to blame me I’m breaking up with you’. He repeatedly said that he’s not blaming me and understood it’s his fault he got up late but that I shouldn’t have recorded anything and that I was just trying to use it against him. Especially after I said ‘you’re probably going to blame me now if you get fired’. I don’t see how needing evidence to back myself up in the future is being petty but I’m looking for outside opinions on this. So AITA?"
111,1jwg8da,Not the A-hole,AITA for pressuring my friend/landlord to let me out of my lease early?,"I currently live with my good friend in a 2 bedroom NYC apartment that he bought 3 years ago. There's no written lease, but every 12 months he raises my rent slightly and says something like, ""Since the lease term has ended, I'm raising your rent 'X%'.""  The rent was reasonable and he's been a great landlord. He fixes everything right away, never asked for a deposit, etc.

3 months ago, in early January, he told me he was kicking me out. His girlfriend was moving in. Of course he was totally justified; I said I completely understood. He gave me 6 months to move out (until the end of our ""lease"") which I likewise found completely fair - since that's plenty of time to find a new place.

I also assumed I could move out anytime prior to the end of the ""lease"" in June/July. If I found a rental that I loved in March, for instance, I believed I could move there, move out of my friend's spot, & not owe him rent for the rest of March, April, May, and June. 

But, a month later, I asked my friend for clarification about when it would be ok to move out. To my surprise, he said he wanted me to wait to move until the ""lease"" ended - which he now said was June 30. He didn't elaborate, and since I tend to avoid arguments, I didn't push back. I said I understood. 

I subsequently spoke w/ my parents, who complained that it wasn't fair for my friend to kick me out AND insist I remain until the ""lease"" ended. I also spoke to a few friends about my friend-landlord's request; they too agreed it wasn't fair. By waiting until the lease ended, I was severely limiting my apartment search, since I wouldn't be able to move into any units on the market between January and April/May-ish.

I went back to my friend and told him I thought it wasn't fair for him to insist I remain in the unit until the end of the ""lease"" on June 30. He adamantly disagreed. I then brought up that my parents and friends also said they thought it wasn't cool. He didn't budge. I decided it wasn't worth jeopardizing our friendship over and told him it was ""fine."" I would remain in the apartment until June 30. And I meant it. I also apologized if I came off as overly harsh.

2 days later, my friend confronted me. He was furious that I had ""badmouthed"" him about the terms of the move-out/lease to my parents and friends. He said I was playing the victim, which he added that I do ""all the time."" When I replied that I merely told my parents and friends the truth - that he kicked me out and wanted me to remain until the end of the lease - he angrily responded that he hadn't truly ""kicked me out,"" since he had given me more than enough notice to move into a new apartment.

After a few minutes of arguing, we agreed to disagree and shook hands. But in the month since the argument, I haven't been able to move on. In my opinion, he's the a--hole for kicking me out, insisting I remain until the end of the lease, AND accusing me of badmouthing him simply for pushing back on his terms.

But is it possible I'm wrong?"
112,1jwfvq6,No A-holes here,AITA for outing someone on accident?,"Okay so in my gym class, I have a partner named Vanessa who has a girlfriend named Ally. (Both fake names). I’m not very close with Vanessa and I’ve never met her girlfriend personally, just seen them together at school. 

A couple weeks ago, Ally and who I assume to be her dad came to my work. Ally’s dad asked if I knew Vanessa and not thinking much of it, I asked her if she was Vanessa’s girlfriend. 

Ally’s dad looked super confused and asked me multiple times “what do you mean by girlfriend?” But he was laughing about it so I’m not sure if he was cool with it or upset and hiding it 

I tried to save it and back track by saying Ally just *looks* like Vanessa’s girlfriend and I must have confused her with someone else, I don’t think he believed me.

Since I’m not particularly close with either of them, it makes sense I could’ve have possibly known if either of them are out to their parents. Both of them are open about being a couple at school so I guess I just assumed their parents knew, which I now realize was dumb assumption to make 

Anyway, I’m not sure what happened with Ally and her dad after they left my work. I’m worried  something might happen to her because of me

Am I the asshole? "
113,1jwfs4g,Not the A-hole,AITA for dressing gorhic/alt at a young age.,"My mother (43F) can be pretty easy going, but she has alot of strong opinions about what she thinks and refuses to hear other people's sides.
I (14F), am currently going through what my mother calls a 'phase'. Which is very often true, but I've loved rock/metal/alt music since a young age and have always wanted to dress like this. This being corsets, nice skirts, some fun eyeliner, big gothic boots, band tee's. Now since I'm at an age with more freedom, I can buy myself cool stuff that I like and wear it. I understand that my mother only wants best for me. But everything I wear the outfits I enjoy, she claims I'm fetishizing myself. I always appease her by putting on leggings, or taking off some of my accessories but I'm always bit annoyed since I'm just having fun. She has since been far more outward and saying that I'm dressing like I'm going to do bdsm due to me wearing corsets and chains and will no longer allow me to wear them. I have been somewhat 'rebellious' and been continuing to wear them despite her screaming. Am I the asshole?"
114,1jwfkp4,Not the A-hole,AITA cause i don’t want my friends friends to move in with us,"for context, apparently his friend needs to move out of his brother in laws by the end of this month and he was told this in january/end of feb. at the time, i didn’t have a job and so i was fine with him moving in with us bc of bills so then i would ask almost every week if his friend is still moving in and he said he hasn’t talked about it since he first brought it up. fast forward to now and im employed and me and my friend assumed the guy wasn’t moving in bc he still hadnt brought it up. well now out of nowhere, the guy is asking my friend when’s a good time to move in and im like like “huh🥴” and now my friend and i are arguing because i don’t want his friend to move in because 1. he didn’t communicate properly and 2. he would only be staying with us for three months which if he really needed a place to stay, i highly doubt that his BIL would kick him out to the curb. i just feel like my friend is blaming it on me and saying it’s my fault that i never told him i didn’t want him to move in now that im employed but at the same time, his friend just assumed he would still have a place to stay after not bringing it up for an entire month and some weeks."
115,1jwfh2f,No A-holes here,AITA for relaxing while my husband cleans,"This happens quite often but today my husband (24M) got home from work like normal i (25F) asked if he wanted a snack and offered to heat up a frozen spinach artichoke dip, he said yes so i made it. I was bringing it over to the coffee table it was very hot and our toddler’s toys were all over the table so I accidentally set it down on a toy and it spilled. It wasn’t such a big deal but he quickly said he could save it and then when he realized he couldn’t he started cleaning it up. I kinda just watched bc it was whatever and I would have just like scooped it up off the table w a pita chip and ate it if it was up to me. He then loudly goes “so are you gonna help me clean it up or not!?” I was like no..? it’s not a big mess, anyway that really pissed him off and he stopped cleaning it and took the baby and stormed upstairs while telling me how pathetic I was and that i could clean it up myself then. 

This also normally happens when he’s putting the dishes away after dinner and i’m sitting on the couch, even tho i made the dinner. He’ll be like “if you’re just gonna sit there go upstairs I don’t wanna see you sitting there while i’m cleaning up”. 

So AITA for not helping my husband clean up and relaxing instead? Any ideas on how to resolve this moving forward? Like the mess will get cleaned up eventually I just don’t wanna do it exactly when he wants it done. "
116,1jwf0w4,No A-holes here,AITA for not always wanting to spend time with my girlfriend’s family?,"Don’t get me wrong I really enjoy her family and fully intend to marry her within a year or so, so I will be apart of their family as well. They are very connected with eachother minus some disputes here and there like a normal family. However multiple times a week there is always a get together of some type that is always an hour or 2 drive away. I work very hard doing construction type work so I get burnt out and one of the last things I want to be around is little kids being obnoxious or ladies being judgmental about everything around them. Her dad is always chill and they all love me, but it’s a totally different vibe than what I’m use to. AITA for wanting to have a week to just relax?

Edit: Sorry first time posting on Reddit. We are both 31, have both lived away from home since 18, we have been dating each other for 1.5 years, have both had long relationships before(hers 9 years, mine 8 years) and we have talked about this before and she is ok most of the time if I don’t want to go but it’s multiple times every single week and she sometimes gets upset. One coming up is a 3 hour drive away that we can’t stay the night at due to our schedule(so 6 hour drive in 1 day)and I made it clear I won’t be going. She isn’t mad when I don’t want to go but her whole family is always doing things so it’s relentless and it is very tiresome. If the get togethers were a 5-20 min drive that’s one thing but 2-4 hours driving time to hang out for the same amount of time after a hard work day/week is rough"
117,1jwezlp,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my therapist about my mom's actions and being 'disrespectful' to my mom?,"I, 17F, have always had problems with my parents (56F and 57M) being overly controlling. I've always tried to be the nicest possible to everyone and my parents, and I rarely lie to them. However, I recently realized that a large majority of the things I had always considered to be normal were not, due to friends or videos online. These things include but are not limited to:

\- Preventing me from buying my own clothes, directing me on what to wear.  
\- Preventing me from going out with my friends unless it is on the same street as where I live.

\- Preventing me from leaving the room without telling them where I am going in our house.

\- Preventing me from leaving the house for more than eight minutes by calling me frantically whenever I leave. I have to take my dog for walks.

\- Preventing me from using regular kitchen units, ex. stove. I am 17.

\- Preventing me from communicating online whatsoever.

\- Regularly booking hair appointments for me without asking whenever she considers it to be 'getting too long.'

\- Getting things taken away whenever I get a grade below 90%.

\- Random insults whenever I try to question her, pointed jokes. My dad doesn't do anything, and doesn't seem to care.

\- Being constantly told that I shouldn't be able to make decisions about anything while at home because 'you're just along for the ride, we didn't decide for you to be here.'

\- Whenever we have a minor disagreement or I try to correct something my mom says, she always starts complaining about how 'disrespectful' I am, and she starts crying and forces me to hug her and then everything goes back to normal as if I said nothing.

Recently, I haven't been doing the best mentally due to this and other things, so I decided to speak up to her about how I've been feeling (not about her, just about how I felt depressed and I wanted to talk to an outside perspective) and convinced her to get me a therapist after a long argument. After my first appointment my mom constantly questioned me about the topics discussed and complained that I was obviously only talking to the therapist about her.\* I didn't really feel like talking to her, and I felt really uneasy, so I wasn't really saying much. She got really angry at me for being 'short' with her, and she kept claiming that I was making myself 'out to be the angel' in all of this, assuming that I had told my therapist, and then stormed off and started crying. I will admit I was being rather rude, and I rolled my eyes. She thinks I'm avoiding her now, and that I'm trying to spend less time with my family. I cut her off accidentally when she told me this, and now she's complaining that they failed in raising me. She just ran upstairs crying 'all we've ever done is love you,' and I feel really depressed like I've done something wrong. I was in fact avoiding them, and I'm not really the best at not showing my annoyance, so it didn't go well.

AITA for telling my therapist about my mom's actions and being disrespectful to my mom?

\* Note of context. My therapist had told me that what I was experiencing was textbook verbal abuse from my mom alongside emotional manipulation, but I didn't tell my mom this."
118,1jweu8a,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for telling my mom to stop taking photos of me?,"For some context, she's always loved taking photos of me (16M) like any parent does, and she's always prefers to stay by my side. But recently she's told me that she has taken pictures of me sleeping, without permission, when I'm doing random stuff, really just any time she finds me to be ""cute"".

I tried to ask her to stop but she got defensive and got mad at me for making it sound like she was being creepy, and I don't wanna be a jerk about it if it's a normal thing. 

We've gotten into multiple arguments about it, and I always end up going silent and being quiet because she ends up either yelling at me or getting all depressed and acting like I just told her I didn't love her anymore.

She's really supportive and has always had my back, and I'm not mad or anything about it, I just wanna know if I'd be a jerk for telling her to stop."
119,1jwe81e,Not the A-hole,AITA for not buying my daughter a new phone charger?,"For context I (38F) have a 15 year old daughter who has a habit of either accidentally losing something or breaking it, and lately I've been having to buy her new phone chargers like crazy because she keeps breaking them. And last time I bought her a new one I warned her that it would be my last time buying her a charger so she better take care of this one. 

And she's been doing good taking care of it until  3 days ago. I heard her arguing with her sister so I went to their room and asked what was going on and her sister told me that she's mad she won't let her use her charger because she's using it. And I asked what happened to hers and I saw a look on her face and instantly I knew she broke it again. And when I asked her if she did, she said yes but it was an accident and I told her that I'm not getting her a new one because I'm tired of wasting my money buying her a charger when she just end's up breaking it. 

And then she asked how is she gonna charge her phone and how she's gonna call me at school when she needs me and do things without her phone, and I said shes I said she's not unless her sister let's her borrow her charger. But then she asked but what about the times her sister says no and I just said she's gonna have to find someway to get her own money to buy the charger on her own and if at school she needs me she can either use the phone at the front office or email me on her laptop. And then she got upset and begged me to buy her a new charger and promised it won't happen again and I said no and walked away.

And it's been 3 days and she still doesn't have a new charger, sometimes her sister will let her borrow hers but eventually she wants her charger back and there's been a couple times where her phone has died and she hasn't been able to charge it and that makes her upset.

And when I talked to my mom about it not too long ago she got mad at me and said I was ""being mean""  and I should buy her a new charger and she even offered to buy it but I said no.

But AITA?"
120,1jwe6yd,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my sister I won’t take her and her caregiver dancing in the city?,"My sister has Down syndrome. She’s fairly high functioning but lives in a group home and attends a day program during the week. We were never super close growing up — she was always hanging in her room, listening to music, dancing, and watching Disney movies while I’ve always been more into the outdoors, sports, and socializing. We’ve always respected each other’s space growing up.

My sister basically never calls me — we’ve maybe talked on the phone 4 times in our lives. But out of the blue, she called me twice one day, left a voicemail (which she never does), and then called again the next night. I was at a baseball game both nights and didn’t answer the first time, but I called her back the second night.

Turns out, she’s making plans for us to “go dancing in [a major city]” with someone she kept calling her “sister.” I was super confused because we don’t have a sister. I eventually figured out that “Hailey,” a staff member at her group home, is who she’s referring to. I’ve met Hailey at a holiday party before — she’s nice, playful, and treats my sister really well — but this whole thing feels very out of character for my sister. My family even commented on how strange it is that she’s suddenly calling me so persistently.

Anyway, her plan is for me to drive to her place (60 minutes each way during rush hour), pick her and Hailey up, and go “dancing” downtown. On a Friday night. In a crowded, expensive city. I really don’t like dancing, especially in that kind of scene, and frankly, I don’t think my sister would enjoy it either — the music, the crowds, the chaos. I told her it didn’t sound fun for me and suggested our dad, who loves to dance and would genuinely have a good time, should come. She was very clear it had to be me, her, and Hailey.

I honestly don’t know if she genuinely wants to hang out with me, or if she’s trying to set me up with Hailey. She’s mentioned “her sister” a couple times in weird ways, and I’ve picked up on subtle things before. Hailey is fine, but she’s not my type, and I would never act on anything because of her professional role in my sister’s life.

So now I’m stuck between:

1. Cancelling and potentially hurting my sister’s feelings or making her feel rejected

2. Going and being miserable all night in a chaotic setting I don’t enjoy

3. Doing all the planning and logistics for something I didn’t ask for and don’t want

I honestly just want a chill night to unwind, not be a chaperone for a random “dancing” plan that feels half-baked and awkward."
121,1jwbcb9,Not the A-hole,AITA for wanting a co-ed baby shower?,"I (32F) and my husband (35M) are expecting our first baby this September.. and let me start out by saying that I do not like showers. Or just parties in general that are focused on me. I’m not trying to sound ungrateful at all.. but I’m really introverted and being forced to sit and open presents while everyone stares at me is my own personal hell. 

I have tried to make a suggestion of doing a cute display table (I tried to suggest this for my bridal shower too) and was immediately shut down by my mother, my MIL, pretty much all of the boomer women were insistent that I MUST open presents at the shower. Because of this, I told my husband I thought it would be a good compromise if we just had a party at our house, co-ed with all friends and family.. then he can open presents with me to take away some of the attention and everyone we love can be there, not just the women. At first he was completely on board and thought it was a great idea.

Fast forward a few months to now, and my MIL offered to host the shower at her house so we didn’t have to worry about hosting, cleaning, etc. Great. Except she said it would be only girls because she doesn’t want to host that many people. All of the sudden she’s pushing me to only invite women, that no men want to go to a baby shower because they just want to drink (which I don’t see an issue with), and it’s just better. I told my husband to tell his mom no. That we appreciate it but we’ll go back to the original plan. Except now he doesn’t want to host it at our house, and is pushing that if it can be done elsewhere to just deal with only women and sitting through my own personal hell while pregnant and easily overstimulated. I said I’d rather not have a shower at all if this was my only option. So AITA for making this such a big deal?"
122,1jwb5nm,Not the A-hole,AITA for saying no to someone asking for a ride.,"So long story short, I told someone no for asking for a ride twice. Initially it started when I offered a ride to event that we are soon in another city. I had one person reach out to accept the offer and even invited them to my social group to coordinate the ride. So far so good, but the next day they asked for a ride hours away into a city for STD testing. I had to tell them no but in return offered them advice on where to go that was much closer and could cover the testing they wanted. Two days later they again ask for a ride to somewhere else on the day we are scheduled to head to said event. To me that felt disrespectful and I told them as such after they asked. 
 They're exact words although cut for sub text was ""it seems a friend wants to meet me on the same days as the event, are you willing to drop me off there instead. I can get a ride back home from someone else."" 
I said ""sorry no, the deal was a ride to the event. I'm going to be frank dude, I don't like you asking for rides all the time. 
I was offering a nice gesture with helping with transportation to the event and it seems you're trying to take advantage of that and it's a bit disrespectful."" 
Now they did go and apologize for asking, but I want to know if I went to far with how I said it. I've been taken advantage of in the past and this kinda bugged me a bit. Especially considering I don't know the person past our group.

124,1jw9i5i,Not the A-hole,AITA for not helping my entitled family members?,"TL;DR: My aunt thinks she’s entitled to the opportunities I’ve worked hard for just because we’re “family.”

I (19F) earned a spot in a highly competitive program when I was in highschool (9 selected students province-wide). My aunt and mom now want me to help get her son (my cousin) in, even though he hasn’t done the work. She’s asked me for favors before—like free concert tickets from when I backup danced for a gig I got through someone else’s connection—and blew up when I said no.

I don’t think her son deserves the spot, and I’m not willing to risk my reputation for them. All of my coworkers and I won all kinds of awards, did a multitude of extracurriculars, and did charity/volunteer work to get into that position. I also still work there but in a different position which could become a conflict of interest due to my former position having to be opposed to my position now. I don't believe her son has the qualities needed for the position nor would he even survive in the interview process comparing him to myself, my coworkers, and the people who have gotten the position in the past.

My mom thinks I owe it to them, but I’ve only ever shared my opportunities with her because she was the one who supported me through them. Her sister hasn’t.

I might just be a jealous prick who won't help them because no one was there to help me. But I don't want to share my hard work with people who I don't feel understand the efforts I put into getting the opportunities I've gotten.

AITA for saying no to helping them?

PS: I will reply in the comments if you guys need more context for things like my job, my relation to them (why i don't consider them family), etc..

EDIT: 
- The job is not for backup dancing
- I was in a position to ask for free/discounted tickets for my mother for the show I was performing in (No avail)
- I'm not trying to be an asshole about how accomplished I am to my aunt, she just need to understand that I am not going to use my golden child powers to get her everything she demands because she and her son feel entitled to it. 
- I simply am asking for advice on how to deal with my mother when she rages at me for not helping her ""sweet baby sister"" OR how to tell my aunt that I have no interest in helping her nor her children because they haven't contributed a thing in my life.

125,1jw9412,Asshole,AITA for calling out a typo in someone's Hinge profile,"I've been using dating apps on and off for several years. I can be a stickler for proper spelling and grammar, and I know it can get obnoxious in certain contexts, so I've learned to be judicious about when to call out infractions. However, I do think when people misspell homonyms (e.g. ""your"" and ""you're"") it can make things harder to read, and sometimes be straight up confusing.

I came across a Hinge profile in which a woman had written a response to the prompt ""Things I look for.."" In her response, she wrote ""We compliment each other."" Even though that's a perfectly valid statement, I just assumed she meant ""complement"", which has an entirely different meaning from ""compliment"".

  
So I reached out with, ""It's important to me that we complement each other in addition to giving compliments."" She responded, ""Did you think this would actually work?"" and then unmatched me.

Am I the asshole?"

My grandparents always come visit for my birthday and my dad decided having his new gf along with her 4 kids come over (despite me not being comfortable with them due to not knowing them overly well) is a good idea. My birthday is roughly a week away and I asked him if he could have them over some other day because I just want to spend time with my grandparents on my birthday. He said that he asked my brother and sister if they wanted his girlfriend and her kids to come over and they didn’t mind. So I said “why didn’t you ask me? It’s my birthday” to which he replied “you always say no to hanging out with them when you visit” (because I wanna relax and see my hometown friends- he’s only asked me like 3x) so then I was mad that he didn’t ask because he knew I’d tell him I didn’t want them at MY birthday."

128,1jw8hrj,Everyone Sucks,AITA for pointing out my roommate's balding?,"My roommate, Andrew, (21M) and I (20M) have been friends since high school. Despite not being very close at the time, we decided to room together our first year of college, as opposed to rooming with a random person cause who knows what they'd be like? It's now our third year, and our relationship has gone downhill. 

For some context, we lived in a dorm on campus our freshman year, not our second, and now have an apartment for this year, and maybe the next (we'll see). My second year, we remained close, but I noticed a clear change in his level of care towards me. I became pretty heavily depressed that year, and he and the rest of our friends were informed of this.

Nonetheless, I put the change in his character aside, and agreed to sign the lease for the apartment we now live in. In hindsight, this was probably the wrong choice, but I thought maybe I was just being more sensitive to comments he made about my mental health. One time he even suggested that my anxiety was me ""playing the long game"" in order to get more attention. 

This all leads up to last night when we were playing a card game. The game is called, ""Bad People"", and it's designed to get friends to turn on each other, so maybe this is what I should have expected, but he seemingly picked me for every card that was negative. For example, he chose me for cards like ""who would you least like to change lives with?"", and so on. I realize this was the point of the game, but even when everyone seemed to agree on the card belonging to someone else in the group, Andrew would say something about people ""going easy on me because I have anxiety"". 

Here's where I might be the asshole. Our friend, Derek, is the judge for this round and it's a fill in the blank card, so he chose the topic, ""Who is the ugliest person in this room?"" I looked up, and sure enough, I see Andrew looking at me, as he puts his card down. So I decided to put down the card that would vote Andrew as the ugliest. When I did this, he got offended, and so did others on his behalf. I said he had no right to be mad as he voted that I was, and he said, ""Just because your facial hair is patchy"", and that's when I told him I voted for him because, ""he's balding"".

Now he won't talk to me and neither will his girlfriend. So, tell me Reddit, AITA?"

She had done a summer internship at this company, and I wasn't aware there was a grad scheme related to it until I was doing my job searching, so I applied but obviously didn't mention it to anyone. However, it turns out we applied for different departments anyways and she got an offer early on which I was super proud of her for, but she isnt going to take it as she's planning on doing a Masters course. I have also received an offer that I do plan on taking but now I feel a sense of guilt since she did mention previously that she thought I should've applied - I should have just said I did in that moment but I felt too awkward to as it felt super abrupt. Now that I have an offer I feel even more anxious about telling her even though we didnt even apply for the same department - I just dont want it to seem like I went behind her back even though I didnt mention ANY applications to anyone.

130,1jw7xw5,Not the A-hole,AITAH for not giving my last graduation ticket to my aunt who pays my phone bill,"I (20s, F) just got my graduation tickets—I was only given five, and I have a big family. Obviously, someone was going to be left out.

Here’s how I split them:
	•	1 for my mom
	•	2 for my sisters
	•	1 for my mom’s twin (my aunt who I’m extremely close to)
	•	1 left

That leaves me with 2 more aunts and a grandmother, so I was already stressed. I told one of my aunts (50F) I had one ticket left and was reaching out to friends for extras. I never said she wouldn’t get one I was still figuring it out.

She immediately called and yelled at me, saying I needed to give the tickets to her and her husband because they’ve “done more” for me than my mom’s twin. She even said I should take the ticket from my mom’s twin and give it to her husband instead.

Then she told me I needed to be mindful of who pays my phone bill. For context: she and her husband are well-off and do help financially, but they’ve always used money as leverage. They also gave me an iPadbut I never asked for any of it. I’ve always said thank you, and when they offer money, I usually say no. The phone bill was something she offered when I was younger to “help my mom” (a single mother of 3), not something I begged for.

My mom, by contrast, has never used money to control us. We didn’t grow up with a lot, but we had a great childhood and real love. I never needed more because I had family.

My mom’s twinthe one she said “hasn’t done enough”has been at every single graduation I’ve ever had. From kindergarten to high school. My 50-year-old aunt and uncle? Always said they’d show up, but never did. Not once. Why would I immediately give a ticket to people who consistently don’t show up just because they have money?

I also never said she couldn’t come. I had just gotten the tickets the day before, and I was trying to make it work for everyone. But instead, I got yelled at, guilted, and told that my love for people should be based on what they’ve given me not how they’ve shown up.

And yes, I’m closer to my mom’s twin. She’s like a second mom. Her daughter is like my sister. That bond is emotional, not transactional.

Now I feel like I’m being punished for not being more “grateful” in the way they want by giving them something I never promised in the first place.

AITAH for not giving my last ticket to my aunt and uncle, and for being closer to the family that’s actually shown up for me?"
131,1jw7v03,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my friend how I feel?,"I (23F) have been best friends with “They” (23F) for 10 years. We’re both Black and lean more blue(dem) than red(rep) politically. They have a very traumatic past family, relationship, and sexual wise. Ik that their past is traumatic but I don’t know everything only bits and pieces when they feel like sharing or if we get into a disagreement. They’ve been in back-to-back relationships since age 16, and two days after being dumped out of a 3 year relationship that they were engaged, they started dating a 35-year-old man—freshly divorced, with a questionable past. He is on probation and taking behavioral classes for assaulting his ex wife He has a now-covered Nazi tattoo (explained as “just punk rock”) and friends who display Confederate flags (which he said is “heritage”).

They told me early on that the relationship made them feel truly seen and cared for, but I voiced concerns: the age gap, how fast it was moving (they hooked up the first night), and that they were already having unprotected sex based on “trust.” I suggested they visit a clinic and expressed worry that they were diving in without healing.

Later, they told me I’d said things that triggered them—like a joke about them possibly being pregnant (I didn’t know they were scared), and when I said they’re not a rehab center for broken men (which they said brought up shame about past experiences as a SW, which I didn’t know at the time). They said they’ve always put others’ emotions before their own, including mine, which is why they never told me I was hurting them.

But what stung was that they did tell their boyfriend everything I said and told him they were second guessing their relationship because of what I said to them. They told them it was important for me to like the person that they are dating. He apparently said he has “nothing against me” but didn’t like what I did in the moment and would “bite his tongue” going forward. So while they didn’t feel safe being honest with me, their best friend of 10 years, they felt comfortable dissecting me with someone they just started dating.

I told them I never meant to hurt them—it came from care, not judgment. We ended the conversation on a positive note, but I’m still feeling really sad and distant. Am I wrong for feeling upset, betrayed, used  and sad.



***They said the guy wants to change and be a better person for them and that the guy makes them feel happy and treats them with respect and accepts who they really are and when they put up a boundary they respect it and try to change. They have also admitted they know this person is a walking red flag but thinks they can change and they can help them and sees the good in them. They have also acknowledged that they can’t be alone and have to be with someone which is why they got into another relationship so fast****

This is the part that is getting me "
132,1jw7q3m,Asshole,AITA for refusing to attend my sister’s wedding,"AITA for refusing to attend my sister’s wedding because I don’t support her relationship?

I (23F) told my sister (23F) that I will not be attending her wedding next month. She’s marrying her fiancé (23M), who she got engaged to after dating for only three months. They met through work and she moved in with him after just a week of talking. 

The reason I’m not going is because I’ve seen a lot of red flags in their relationship. He name-calls, gaslights, isolates her from her friends, and any time they fight, they both immediately go talk to *his mom* instead of handling it together. It feels like his mom is a third party in the relationship. 

I also know he was texting other girls and even had his ex over at his house *while* talking to my sister before she moved in. He doesn’t have a driver’s license, works an entry-level job, and has no long-term goals (no college or trade school plans). He relies heavily on his parents, especially his mom—his apartment is just 10 minutes from their house, and she’s deeply involved in their lives. 

My sister only calls me to complain about his behavior, and I live in another state, so I’ve never been able to see the good side she claims he has. My mom and I have been excluded from all the wedding planning, and her fiancé has made zero effort to get to know us. His mom even called *my* mom “stuck up” after one group dinner. Despite all this, they expect us to support the marriage unconditionally.

I told my sister I wouldn’t be attending because I don’t feel comfortable pretending to support something I don’t believe in, and I don’t want to risk ruining her day by being there and feeling resentful or upset.

Now, her friends are saying I’m just jealous that she’s getting married, and that I should suck it up and go anyway just to make her happy.

So—AITA for choosing not to attend my sister’s wedding because I don’t support her relationship and don’t want to fake it?
Edit: I was not expecting so many comments on this. I appreciate all of you guys for providing other insights and opinions! "
133,1jw7988,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my girlfriend not to join me on vacation because of her financial situation?,"I (26M) have been dating my girlfriend (25F) for almost a year. Soon, I’ll be traveling to Las Vegas for a work event. My company is covering my round-trip international flight and expenses during the event. After that, I’m planning to use my vacation days to spend some time in Florida — that part will be paid out of my own pocket (domestic flight, accommodation, food, etc.).

My girlfriend wants to join me in Florida, but she’s not in a good financial situation. I just received my annual bonus, which is just enough to cover my own travel plans. She doesn’t have the money and suggested asking her dad to help cover the trip.

Here’s the thing: I know her family is struggling. They don’t have a car, there’s often a lack of basic groceries at home, no proper shower stall, no curtains — things like that. So it really doesn’t sit right with me that she’d ask her dad for money to go on vacation while those basic needs are unmet.

I’d love to travel with her someday, but I feel like this just isn’t the right moment. I’m worried she’ll take it personally or think I don’t want her there. But to me, encouraging her to spend (or borrow) money for this trip feels irresponsible.

**AITA for thinking she shouldn’t come and should use the money for more important things?**"
134,1jw74re,Not the A-hole,AITA for saying no to my MIL moving in with us right now?,"My (31F) husband (30M) and I got married a month and a half ago. Just three weeks after our wedding, his father passed away unexpectedly. The grief has been immense, and I’ve been doing my best to support him while also navigating my own health issues—I’m currently on medical leave and emotionally stretched thin. I’ve travelled halfway across the world to be with him and I’m staying at his mother’s home right now.

We’re South Asian, and my husband is the only son, which comes with a lot of cultural pressure to “step up” and care for his mother, especially now. I understand this deeply—men in our culture often feel indebted to their mothers, and caregiving is seen as a duty and a form of love. I respect that.

That said, his mother will be coming to Canada and will be living primarily with his sister, who has a bigger home and a child. She’s not homeless or without support. The idea came up that she might stay with us periodically, and we were going to give up our current apartment to move into a bigger place (which would’ve cost over $1,000 more in rent) to accommodate her.

I didn’t feel ready for that, especially because: •I don’t feel fully comfortable around her yet—we’re still getting to know each other •We haven’t even settled into married life yet •I’m still processing grief, health issues, and the emotional whiplash of our wedding + his father’s death •Before we got married, I had expressed clearly that I was not comfortable living with his parents, but I would be okay living close by so we could visit and support them. I’m not as close to my parents and they would never make me feel obligated to care for them. I come from a more independent background

To make things worse, the day after our wedding, my MIL told me that I needed to “lose a decent amount of weight” so I could look “prim and proper” and that she could get new clothes made for me. That comment sent me into a massive spiral—I regressed into a teenage version of myself, full of shame. It took me weeks to emotionally recover. My husband and his sister stood up for me, and MIL did apologize, but it still affected my sense of safety and comfort around her.

When I told my husband I wasn’t comfortable moving or having her stay with us right now, he said he felt depressed and like he doesn’t have a “supportive wife.” He asked “What if in two years you still say no?” and said I was being closed off. I tried to explain my side—gently—but he cut me off, said I was “going on a spiel” and that I kept repeating myself. Then he shut down completely and said, “I’m just trying to sleep.”

I feel gaslit. I’ve never said “never” to his mom staying with us. I just said “not yet.” I need time to adjust, to settle into this marriage, and to feel like I have a home that’s ours—not a space where I’m a third wheel in a family dynamic that existed long before I joined it.

135,1jw713c,Everyone Sucks,AITA for telling my girlfriend her Instagram photos are too edited and saying I’ll post the originals if she doesn’t take them down?,"My girlfriend (29F) (who has a decent following on instagram) and I (35M) just got back from a trip to Mexico. We took a ton of photos, most of them on my phone cause I have a better camera, and today she posted a bunch on Instagram but they were all edited using FaceApp or something.

She edited so much, she changed her chin, made her eyes slightly bigger, narrowed her shoulders and waist, and gave herself a perfectly round butt that straight-up does not exist in real life. She also edited my face without asking me.

I compared them to the originals and told her it’s too much, I said editing yourself like that is basically lying, and it makes both of us look fake and she said I was overreacting.

I told her to take them down and she refused, so I told her if she keeps them up then I'll post the originals. She’s pissed now and says I’m being mean and that it's not a big deal.

I don’t think I’m the asshole — I just don’t want to be part of some fake version of ourselves online. AITA?"
136,1jw6u50,Not the A-hole,AITA for nor saying hello directly to my mom's friend?,"So yesterday I went to a park where my mom and her friends hang out, I know most of them and as usual I went to them and said hi to anyone that noticed me, I didn't say hello to everyone cause a few of them were chatting and didn't look at my way, I didn't want to interrupt and left to take a walk.

Apparently, one of my mother's friends (let's call her Mary) was very upset that I didn't say hello directly to her, she told my mom that she even waited for me to come and ask about her wellbeing eventually, but was very disappointed. She then compared me to someone else's daughter (who's also a close friend of mine) saying that ""Really, (friend's name)'s communication skills are totally different from (My name)'s"". 

Now, saying hello and asking for someone's wellbeing is very important in our culture, it's a social rule for everyday small talk when you meet somebody, but I've always been introvert and shy, I usually just say hello and don't bother to start a conversation. Mary is also somebody that I've attended her birthday parties, she's always been kind to me, but I don't think that I was rude or inconsiderate towards her enough for her to make a comparison to my best friend, for just not saying a casual hello.

You tell me, was I a bit of an asshole?"
137,1jw6fcq,Not the A-hole,AITA for moving out with telling my bf about it,"English isn’t my first language, so please forgive any errors. For background, my boyfriend and I were childhood classmates. Back then, I had a horrible math teacher who often picked on me, and I struggled with even basic math. My now-boyfriend used to laugh along when the teacher embarrassed me, though I had a huge crush on him.

I eventually took it as a challenge and worked hard to overcome my difficulties. Today, I have a bachelor's and a master’s degree in math. Two years ago, I moved to Germany and needed accommodation. Through a WhatsApp group, I found a shared apartment with two Indian girls, M and D, and a guy—who turned out to be my former classmate. He didn’t recognize me at first, but we eventually talked, and he apologized for how he treated me back then.

In our second year of the master’s program, he asked me out, and I said yes. D wasn’t happy about it. We worked the same part-time job, and she told people there that I ""stole her boyfriend."" People treated me poorly for weeks. When I confronted her, she claimed she was just joking and meant I “stole him as a friend.”

Later, she got drunk, confessed her love for him, and called me slurs. The next morning, she said it was another joke. We distanced ourselves from her, but she begged my boyfriend to reconcile. I stayed polite but kept my distance.

After finals, I got an internship in another city, which could lead to a full-time job. I also needed to move out because of D’s bullying—adding salt to my food, spilling coffee on my bed, etc. My boyfriend originally suggested we move to that city together. While applying for the internship, he agreed to look for jobs there. But after I got it, he seemed off. When I asked if he’d made progress, he snapped and called me clingy and obsessive—as if I followed him to Germany just to date him (though he asked *me* out).

During this fight, D showed up and said she and my boyfriend had secretly applied to jobs in a different city, two hours away. He didn’t tell me because he thought I’d be “possessive.” Later, he apologized but still justified moving in with D and M instead of me because D was feeling distant and he’d promised to “take care of them.”

I asked where I stood in his future plans. He said he still loved me but asked me to understand D’s feelings. That was my breaking point. I quietly packed and left to stay with a friend. He didn’t text me all week. After I moved out, he sent me a long message calling me ungrateful and crazy. His friends also messaged me, calling me a loser for “fumbling” him despite knowing what D did.

I still love him, but I feel deeply disrespected and unvalued. I tried to communicate but wasn’t heard. I think I deserve better than someone who can’t set boundaries. So AITA?"
138,1jw60es,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my gf to pay veterinarian cost for our cat?,"Long story short, over the years we have had two cats, one passed away 3 years ago  due to urine complications. He passed on the operation table. Very sad yes, and the cost for it was 3.000 dollars. We have combined economics and it was a no brainer to try rescue him.

After that my gf wanted a new cat, but I refused since the cost is too much. I’m not willing to risk our economic future. It’s to much money. After some weeks of talking she said she will pay if something went wrong. (She has own money besides our combined money since before us) she also said she would take 100% responsibility for daily care of the cat to. Food, water etc. 

Fast forward til this week that cat is now sick with similar problems like our cat who passed had. We already paid 300 dollars for vet costs. Cat ain’t getting better and worst case scenario he ends up on the operating table. I brought this deal up and she freaked out telling me how awful I am and that I don’t care. I do but I didn’t sign up for this… it will take years to save this money up again.

AITA?"
139,1jw5yij,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my mom she can’t watch my baby?,"For backstory, I (33F) am pregnant with my first child. My husband (34M) and I live in a major city where most people don’t have cars / drive. We walk basically everywhere (or take the subway). My mom, whom I love, (60F) is morbidly obese. She’s always been “bigger,” but in the past 10 years has gotten close to 400 lbs. She can’t walk 2 city blocks without sitting, can’t do any stairs, and can’t really fly unless she buys two seats. She complains of pain whenever she has to carry things. We’ve (my sisters and I) encouraged her to go to a doctor. The doctors and specialists all said her hormones are fine, it’s overeating and she needs to lose weight for health reasons. My mom sneaks snacks and doesn’t eat healthy m.

My husband and I live in a walk up. I’m due in June, and my mom asked if she can come up and help with the baby the first few weeks. I said of course, all help is always appreciated. Then she said that she would like my husband and I to have her as childcare for a few months instead of doing daycare (which we already have enrolled in). We told her we already have a daycare but appreciate the offer and she can come visit anytime. My MIL is coming for a few weeks after my mom, and we told my mom she can come right after that again if she wants and we can book her flight for her. 

She kept insisting, saying she would be better than a “random childcare person.” We told her babies are a ton of work and she can come visit, but we don’t expect her to watch the baby full time. She told us we were making a major mistake not taking her up on daycare. She kept pushing it and said we’d regret not taking her up on her offer, and I finally told her I don’t want her watching the baby because of her weight - if there is an emergency, she can’t take the baby on a walk or even get the stroller out of the house. Our nursery is on the top floor, so I don’t think she could even get our baby up and down the stairs. 

She started crying and said I hate her because she’s fat. I told her that’s not true, but I have to think about in an emergency how she could help the baby, and that’s my first concern. I love my mom, but I don’t think she physically could handle taking our baby out or up stairs. 

Now she’s not speaking to me, and told my sister I “am embarrassed of her.” She also said I prefer my MIL because she’s thin (something I have never brought up and we aren’t using my MIL as daycare). I don’t think I was mean and wasn’t going to mention her weight until she pushed it, but now I think I’m the asshole because my family is divided. So Reddit, AITA?"
140,1jw5mu1,Not the A-hole,AITA for not being the first to apologize to my friend after he yelled alot of hurtful things?,"This friend is my ex if that helps at all. We still live together so it's pretty tense - it started when I off handedly said something about not going out of my way to go the store just to get him something, and he flipped out. He did me a favor a couple weeks ago and wanted it to be paid back by me buying him something and I just forgot due to how much work I have. The way I worded it was rude apparently and suggested I didn't care enough to repay the favor and that was what irked him. I tried to explain that I was sorry, I didn't know it was so important to him or else I would've went sooner and that I wanted to actually talk and figure it out. But he just kept yelling and shouting mean things and saying how selfish and what a bad person I was and that I was a liar before leaving and slamming the door. It was so quick I just sat there for a minute. 

I cried for a little but shrugged it off - I did want to talk to resolve it and understand, but everything he said just made me indifferent. I didn't want to go apologize to someone that acted in a horrible way towards me over a mistake. I went out for the day to clear my head and when I came back, he made me a dish as a peace offering. He said he was sorry, and that he was upset but that didn't give him the right to yell or say mean things. I'm glad he recognized it, so now I felt better and actually wanted to apologize as well, so I did. It got twisted pretty quickly though. He didn't think my attempts to apologize when he was mad counted since it didn't feel genuine. Okay, I explained that it was all so quick and I couldn't get any words out or even really have time to understand since I was just being yelled at. Then he said he shouldn't have even been the one to apologize first since I was the one that caused HIS reaction. What? 

He kept going on about how I should've taken responsibility as an adult to be the first to apologize when I wronged someone no matter how they react verbally. I said no, that is not how I see the world and frankly can lead to some abusive situations and he just started getting upset again - he said he barely said anything mean, and that it did not constitute as verbal abuse, and that it was how the world worked, that people will yell and that it is human. I said I do not agree with that and it is not how I want MY world to look like. He kept trying to convince me or make me feel bad for thinking that way, saying it was crazy and it is a dick move and that I should feel guilty. But... I don't feel guilty for not apologizing first. He yelled at me, he said horrible stuff, and when I tried to talk to him he shut me off. I did everything I could in the moment to calm things down even if it didn't feel like it to him. Yes, I know that when people are mad they won't listen, but after I am called names I want nothing to do with them and expect them to come to resolve things if they want to since I don't know when they will cool down! I don't think it is selfish. But AITA???"
141,1jw58xp,No A-holes here,AITA for not asking a friend to be part of my bridal party?,"For context, I have asked my closest friends of 15+ years to be part of my bridal party. This other friend I have known since college and while we are close, she is not part of my core group of girls. Over the past few years, we only really see each other once very few months, text here and there, but have a snap streak running (which I don’t consider communication  because it’s just random images). 

While she claims I told her a while ago that I said she could be a bridesmaid, I sincerely don’t think I did and have given no such inclination over the last few years, especially after I got engaged. She talked to me from a place of hurt after finding out recently I’m going on my Bach trip with just my bridesmaids (no other friends outside of this group) and I explained to her that my decision for my bridal party was completely based on who I’ve viewed my closest friends since high school, but also that we haven’t been significantly close over the last few years because of her schedule. I even remember earlier this year when we met in person that she asked if I was going to have bridesmaids and I specifically mentioned “yes, I will be asking those girls in a few days” to which she didn’t really respond to and changed the subject. I even reposted some of the stories on my social media when my girls posted about it. Perhaps I should have been more clear here?

I was most confused and frustrated by her making a claim that “even if you asked me I would have said no” but she felt like I took the decision away by automatically excluding her from a group of girls she has never been close to, nor speaks to unless she meets them at my birthday gatherings in the past. 

She had also asked for advice on Reddit prior to us having that conversation and without providing this additional context and while i know it is just strangers, i felt hurt by the things people claimed were my intentions or making false claims like “she’s embarrassed by you which is why she didn’t ask”. It’s weighed heavily on my mind and I hate feeling this way when I’m supposed to be enjoying this time as I plan for the wedding. The stress of planning a wedding and trying to appease people feels like it’s compounding and this was out of the blue and overwhelming for me. While I think I handled myself well when we had the conversation, it’s continued to weigh on my thoughts and need to get this off my chest. "
142,1jw4rer,Not the A-hole,AITA for staying with my mom whil my partner’s best friend is visiting?,"My fiancés best friend came out to visit and stay with us for a week. To preface, I’ve heard them talk on the game to each other and his friend is always making divorce jokes and even told him he has terrible taste in women (my fiance is divorced, something he did when he was in the military). He doesn’t know me that well so that comment really rubbed me the wrong way. Already went into this feeling off about it, but promised myself I wouldn’t get confrontational or ruin my partner’s time with his friend. Anyway, last night we were hanging out and my fiance had made a “my fiance says I have a small penis” joke (which was already weird to say, I don’t know if he was trying to be funny or what but I corrected him and said I never would say that nor have I ever prior). Prefacing, I’m a bigger person and on an open and healthy weight loss journey. My fiance is a bigger guy too; both of us will never be skinny and bones because we just have bigger body frames. Anyway, after he said that, he friend says “yeah well my girlfriend is 90 pounds so anything is big to her” which REALLY rubbed me the wrong way. Regardless of this, he is ALWAYS trying to one up my partner and ALWAYS has something to counter what he’s saying. This includes his weight. I’m  over it. I decided to remove myself from the situation all together and stay at my mom’s till he leaves, just because I can be super confrontational, and like I said I don’t want to ruin anything for my partner. They’re also constantly drinking it feels like, and not only am I sober but because I’m not partaking I find it obnoxious. My partner is upset that I’m choosing to stay with my mom, but I’d rather do that than the latter. Am I the asshole?"
143,1jw4gnx,Everyone Sucks,AITA for calling my homegirl out?,"So, me and my homegirl had an argument the other day. She said she would pick me up before she went shooting, but she never did—and later told me she forgot.

BTW, this has happened many times before. This is not the first time, and she always has an excuse (not a good one, mind you). It's always something like, “Sorry, my mom said no.” She still lives with her mom—and so do I, no shame in that.

But this time, I told her that if she doesn’t want to hang out, she can just say so instead of “forgetting” and leaving me hanging. I told her it's starting to piss me off because it’s been happening ever since she got with her boyfriend.

Now, her boyfriend is friends with my boyfriend—not the point, I know—but half the time she says she can’t hang out, she’s actually with my boyfriend. She’s also said “We should hang out soon” so many times, but never makes plans. And when we do make plans, she cancels last minute.

She basically told me she never said she would pick me up, which my boyfriend said isn’t true—because she said it in front of him before I dropped him off at his house (he had work). I told her I know she said it, and that she needs to start communicating with me instead of leaving me hanging every time we try to hang out.

She said I was being “pushy.” I told her that if she wants me to stop, she needs to tell me—because I’m not a mind reader. I’ll never know unless she says something.

Then I got heated and called her an addict… to gardening. She said she wasn’t, but she always gets mad easily when she doesn’t have it. Then I told her the whole group has seen how she and her boyfriend have pushed themselves out.

Then she called all of them “lonely ass.” I took a screenshot of that one text—she called it immature—but I sent it to my boyfriend (because he already knows what’s been going on). He saw it and got pissed.

She took screenshots of the convo too, so I did the same and sent them to my boyfriend again.

Then she apologized for blowing up at me—which, let’s be real, was just to save her own ass. I said, “If you could just communicate with me, that would be great.”

And no, it doesn’t end there (don’t worry, I thought it did too). Her boyfriend got mad—his brother is also in the friend group—and asked my boyfriend what happened. My boyfriend showed him the screenshots I had sent, and he said I was in the right and that he was glad I put her in her place.

Then his other brother found out what was happening (he saw all the drama go down at their house) and also said I was in the right.

IDK how, but one other person in our friend group found out too—and they also agreed with me. They all said I did the right thing.

Then her boyfriend (not mine) started calling everybody and bitching at them. He did it to the first brother that found out, then called my boyfriend and asked him to delete the screenshots. He didn’t yell at my boyfriend, but my boyfriend said no—he wasn’t deleting anything—and that if they didn’t apologize to everybody in the group, he’d send the screenshots in the group chat.

They hung up and started texting people to apologize.

So... AITA for getting mad at her?"
144,1jw4158,Not the A-hole,AITA for not buying my coworkers food when they already ordered food.,Okay so I work at a  pharmacy and my manager offered to order food for everyone. I declined cause I wasn’t really hungry at the moment but the more it got closer to lunch I was a little hungry and my coworkers  had already got their food. So I decided to order something small for lunch  (not from the same place of course) and when my food came in my one coworker an older lady  looked at me with a look of betrayal saying why didn’t I order them food or ask them. I was like you guys already ordered food and I didn’t want any so I decided later I wanted one. She got snappy and said I should have offered my hard earned money when I’m literally on a budget atm due to having to pay medical bills from a injury and did not want to spend 30+ dollars in money when user an ordering app that rhymes in floorbash . My other two coworkers both looked at me with a weird look like I’m crazy for not buying them food after they ordered. Between the looks they gave me and the fact that I could afford paying for (even though it might cause me a set back in paying for my bills) even though it’s my money I feel like the jerk kinda even though I know I’m not. so I’m here asking  aita for ordering my own food when they my coworkers already got something  
145,1jw3u92,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to watch more Star Wars with my friend?,"Okay so my friend LOVES Star Wars. I personally really struggle to get into them. We’ve watched the entire original trilogy together and I told them that I can definitely appreciate the hype surrounding them and that I love the camp-ness of it all and the artistry of them. I also told them that while I can appreciate them, that I don’t enjoy watching them. I know they are movies that my friend holds very dear to their heart, but I feel like watching three of them is enough for me to know that I don’t have any interest in continuing. They definitely take my lack of enthusiasm towards Star Wars personally. I end up feeling incredibly guilty for never wanting to watch them. We have had numerous conversations regarding how I feel about it and how they feel about it, and I always feel like asshole. I don’t know if I should just suck it up and get through them all or if I should lay my foot down and say that I don’t want them coming over to my apartment to watch movies I have no interest in. Please tell me if I am in fact being an asshole or if I’m being reasonable lol"
146,1jw3c80,Not the A-hole,AITA for defending my friends?,"I was 13 at the time and life was getting better for me. I was feeling happier, I was being more active, I got my first ever PC and finally got rid of my horrible LapTop that hardly functioned.

Although, for my friend, it was becoming worse. His dad was going to the hospital and schoolwork was flooding him drastically. I stayed supportive of whatever he decided and eventually told me everything. 

To sum it up, his friend ( who we’ll call Uber ) was changing him for the worse. He said he was becoming ruder and more aggravated after playing with Uber. I believed him and wanted to go with whatever he wanted. I already had suspicions and didn’t like Uber as it was only a month before that there was a massive argument. Me and my friend thought nothing of it, until the news broke out to him. He started demanding to know what was going on and even invited his friends to back him up. 

Let's call this specific friend Earl. Earl was very annoying, persistently asking what happened, although I must have explained about 4 times. It got so bad I used ;shutdown to well, shutdown the server as it was too chaotic. My Friend though, distraught. Shivering, crying. You get the gist. And as soon as we though maybe nothing would happen. Then it started. The begging. The crying the pleading. We wanted none of it and so we tried to get them to leave but eventually Earl came back. He started changing and manipulating what I said to mean other things. Eventually saying stuff like “Can’t you see, he is clearly changing you for his benefit”. I couldn’t believe it. I was involved in some sort of war, all because I wanted to be there with my friend. 

After some motivation I decided the best I could do was offer him some help. He was all I had when I was depressed so I felt compelled to help him. Hours turned into days, days into weeks of struggling and fighting all for the same things. “He’s controlling you” “Why would you want this” “Your heartless”. None of this helped my situation and especially my sleep patterns, some days I was up at 3am. Getting countless nosebleeds, crying and defending.

It’s making me think maybe I am the true villain here. If I just made things worse. My friend thinks I’m not, he wants my support and help and there wasn’t a real solution or talk. Just silence. 

Am I the Asshole? "
147,1jw3a5v,Everyone Sucks,AITAH for asking space from a friend,"I have a friend group in a city and we are all in our mid twenties. Recently friends moved away and I had a falling out with one of the girls who I had originally introduced to the group. She was supposed to pet sit and lied about not taking care of my pet and did not come to take care of him while I was out of town. It was a five day trip where I found out on the last day that she had not been taking care of my pet. I have cut her out since as this was a violation of trust that had a significant impact on my pets safety. Since then, it’s been awkward with friends. I have tried to reach out to everyone individually and stay in close contact after. My closest friend in the group “Sara” told me she didn’t care about what happened because it didn’t happen to her. I was shocked about the lack of support. Since that fight she had stopped reaching out to me and initiating plans. I noticed the friend group was still getting together and taking big trips all while inviting this other girl and leaving me out. I started to distance myself from them. Sara reached out to me in December to talk about this and gave me I would call a half apology where she did acknowledge that she hadn’t been reaching out but she said this was due to work and didn’t address the root issue. I told her at this time it was very hurtful to see friends get together and not invite me as I was the one who was consistently being left out. She told me it was not her fault as she was not the one planning things. Since then, we have stayed in contact although I have made a significant attempt to create better friendships else where. Recently I also went through a very hard break up with someone. It’s been very hard and I had to go home for a while for my mental health. When I returned to the city, I found out that this group was planning another trip without me. I felt like I was being kicked while I was down and was very upset that I was being excluded again while going through something very painful. Sara had been reaching out the past few weeks to get together but every time I thought about seeing her I was filled with dread. I told her I needed space to process everything. Sara got very angry at me for this and said I had no right to be upset at her for the trip as she was not the one to plan it. She told me i could talk to the other girls about it but I can’t blame her for their actions. She had asked them how they would handle this situation and in doing so felt like she had stuck up for me. I see that differently as she was more concerned with being put in the middle than how it would impact me. She is still actively participating in a dynamic where I’m the one who is always left out. When I told her this she pointed to me making new friends and not including her there as a justification for why it’s ok that I’m left out. AITAH?"
148,1jw38yz,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I threw away/donated my ex boyfriends clothes now he’s back from deployment?,"So back in November, I (F21) started dating a guy (F23) who is in the Royal Navy. Things moved pretty quickly—we really liked each other, were falling in love, and despite him going on deployment shortly after we met, we decided to try to make it work.

Unfortunately, it didn’t. He broke up with me pretty suddenly a few weeks ago, and since then, I’ve barely heard from him. We had our first proper conversation a week ago- he told me he’s been writing poems and stories about me since the breakup that he wants to give me when he’s eventually home. 

Before he left, he left some of his things at my place, including a really expensive pair of hiking boots. I live in a tiny studio flat, but I told him I’d hold onto them unless I had to move for a new job (which I was considering at the time). That felt like a fair compromise.

Fast forward: it’s been four months, he’s been back in the UK as of late March, and instead of coming to collect his things, he’s gone off to Scotland for a few weeks and hasn’t told me when he’ll be back in our city. Meanwhile, his boots (and a few other bits) are still taking up space in my already-cramped flat. It has been almost 5 months. 

I feel like I’ve been patient and reasonable, but I’m also trying to declutter and move on, and I don’t think it’s fair that I’m still storing stuff for someone who dumped me and isn’t making an effort to collect it.

That said—I don’t want to seem like an asshole for suddenly throwing away his things when I promised I’d keep them stored for him whilst he was away on deployment. Especially as this deployment was really hard on him and I don’t wanna make things worse. He also wants to give me the collection of poems when he’s home. 

WIBTA?

Edit- to add on, he ignored my text asking when he’s back in the UK. I was very polite about it too. 

UPDATE- thank you everyone for the advice about giving him a deadline! He surprisingly responded immediately saying I can just keep the items and then blocked me (not sure why!) but the great news is I can sell the boots and donate the rest. "
149,1jw365r,Everyone Sucks,AITA for shouting at my mam when she tried to give me medication,"So i \[M16\] had Just got home when my mam \[F49\] came in to my room holding a glass of what looked like a glass of juice with a strange frothy fizz stuff in it and demanded that I drink it. I got really confused and asked her why she refused to explain and kept saying I should drink it.

I finally managed to get her to tell me why, it was because she caught an illness from someone at her job, for extra info she works as a children’s entertainer and kids spread this specific illness pretty easy compared to teens and adults. she asked me a few questions about if id had what I assume are symptoms. I didnt really know too much about this illness so I calmed down and started drinking the juice (which I now found out had medicine dissolved in it)

about half way through I looked it up. The illness isn’t really that contagious it’s only Really possible to catch in two ways both of which aren’t happening all the time (it’s not airborne or anything like that) i got really pissed at her and shouted for her to leave because I am an overthinker and I tend to placebo affect myself into thinking I have whatever illness people say the symptoms for and she’d really scared me about something that was pointless and had made the whole situation quite scary. I started telling her off about it and went for a walk for like two hours

once I got back I didn’t go near her and acted sorta cold to her and now I kinda think I am the asshole. What do y’all think? Am I the asshole?"
150,1jw2fv7,Not the A-hole,AITA for being in a mood because of how I’m treated?,"So basically, my sister keeps complaining that I’m in a bad mood all the time then proceeds to paint herself as a victim, saying I get angry for nothing and I “act like I’m going through so much” but she doesn’t even know what she acts like. I’m literally treated like a dog and earlier in the day, she literally clicked her fingers to get my attention. I think she’s really manipulative, she guilt trips me for things I wasn’t to be blamed for. For example how my parents “liked me better than everyone else” which I can confirm was not true since they treated me exactly the same despite being the youngest at the time. I wasn’t given princess treatment as a kid, and I think I was treated worse. Everyone took advantage of me being the youngest to make me into their personal assistants. And she also said I’m so lazy and thinks I complain too much even though I stay silent when they taunt, offend, hurt me. Sometimes I think I’m the problem but I have to remind myself that I was never treated like a person ever since. So aita? (Btw I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety but there wasn’t a proper checkup so there’s possibilities that it could be something else)"
151,1jw0yq9,Not the A-hole,AITA for continuing to curse whenever my religious dad says a slur?,"My (21) dad has always been religious, but he never raised us to be and so never forced his beliefs upon us. Recently, however, he's been getting really mad at me whenever I curse even though I've been doing it since forever. I also hear him doing it every now and then as well, so I'm really confused about the sudden switch up.

A few weeks ago, my dad said a racial slur, and we got into a huge argument about it. I've explained to him so many times now why it's offensive and racist, but he continues to use that word. I then came up with a deal he agreed to: if he stops saying that word, I'll stop cursing.

Yesterday, he used that word again and so I cursed again, after which he got insanely mad at me. I don't even think they're equally disrespectful; him continuing to be willfully racist seems worse to me than me just cursing. I know this sounds childish of me, but I get upset when people try to force their ideas about religion on me.

Now I'm wondering if I'm the asshole in this scenario and if I should just stop cursing to keep the peace.AITA for continuing to curse whenever my religious dad says a slur?"

153,1jw0l2f,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my sister to clean up her mess,Let me explain. My sister is 16 and all she does is lay around and be rude to everyone in my household and family. Me and her share a space on the 2nd floor of my house and we have a laundry room we share. She does not respect this space and literally leaves sweaty stinky clothes and stained underwear in a pile in the middle of the door. I literally cannot do my laundry anymore because I can’t get around it. I’ve tried to be nice about it but my mom won’t talk to her. She says she’ll take care of it but it’s been months of me asking to get this taken care of and nothing ever happens while the disgusting pile of clothes grows higher and higher. I want to tell her myself so badly to get her lazy ass up and do it herself instead of making my mom think she has to. My mom doesn’t need more things to do for her children in her everyday life as we have a disabled child living with us already. The least my sister should do is just clean up her messes from time to time instead of making me and mom do it. She also 100% talks shit about me to her friends at school for little to no reason because all I’ve done is ask her to do her chores or clean up and she says “you do it” and obviously I get mad. Not to also mention she is too lazy to get up and shower or brush her teeth or anything. The only thing she will get up for is if she is forced to or if she wants food. And before you say it could be a mental illness. It’s not. I come in her room everyday to say hi and she seems completely fine. So am I the asshole 
154,1jw00zu,Not enough info,AITA Yelled at my mom over issues with my pet,"I have a pet snake who, by the way, is very docile contrary to popular belief. Anyway, my mom wants him gone because she does not want pets in the house and she is terrified of snakes. I tried to reason with her, telling her that he is not aggressive and having a snake is almost like having a pet rock. The care is easy and his enclosure will be in my room. She still refuses and threatens that if I do not have him gone by Thursday, she is going to dump him in the woods. So fine, I went on Facebook and found somebody who is able to rehome him. Problem is, though, we go to Europe on Friday, the day after she expects him gone. The person who is willing to rehome him has work on Thursday and I have to go to both school and work, so she suggested we meet during the weekend. Again, I go to Europe on Friday, so unfortunately that would not be possible. I told my mom that I found somebody who is able to take him, but it would have to be after our trip to Europe and she, and I quote, responded with “okay fine”. That was on Tuesday night, and now fast forward to today (Thursday), my mom asked me if he is going to be gone by today. I was confused. I told her on Tuesday he would be gone the day after we come back from Europe and I explained to her why Thursday would not be possible, and she told me, “I am so disappointed in you. You keep lying to me”. ?????????? Woman I literally explained everything to you a couple days ago. We kept going back and forth and I eventually asked her, “Are you dumb??”. I am absolutely terrified of my mom and would never in my 18 years say that to her, but I seriously reached a breaking point because she always goes back on her word. She is always like this, but now I feel terrible for saying that to her. Am I an asshole for calling her dumb??

PS - guys. The issue is not that I have to give him away. The issue is that three days ago, she told me it was okay that I give him away in a week. Now she is telling me I have to get rid of him today. She is going back on her word and is pretending like she isn’t. Also, she told I could get a pet as long as I did not financially contribute to it. Now she does not want one. "

156,1jvzmy8,Not the A-hole,AITAH for “throwing a fit” when my  gf “body shamed” me,"Im in the early stage of a relationship with a friend ive known for years.

And ive shared many gym progress pics of myself to her request which she used to consistently compliment a lot

Then she stopped complimenting but then periodically asking for some

Then she said my legs were small

Then, a week later she said my bicep was small (after basically asking for a pic)

Then I called her out for “body shaming” and she said ""mb""

To which I said I wasn't satisfied with just a ""mb""

Note: prior to this I “teased her” for doing a lower level maths than me and she made it known that she did not like it to which I apologised profusely 

I asked her how she would feel if I were to say the alternative:

“How would you feel if I said your ass was small (this is not based on anything)”

 \*as in I was clarifying that I didn’t actually think her ass was small\*

To which she replied “my ass is small, I wouldn’t care”

After I called her out on ""body shaming"" she basically clarified that she meant the picture made my bicep look smaller than other pics she has of me, not that my bicep itself was small and she made a distinction between what I experienced and what “body shaming” really is 

And that when I still took issue with her commenting small to my pic (regardless if she meant it reflecting irl) she said she wouldn’t apologise for her own individual opinion because “that’s how she was raised”

And then she related that to me having an ""ego"" for ""throwing a fit"" at her merely commenting small, where I replied that i found it unfair to tie tearing down my self esteem to having an ego

157,1jvz7vp,Not the A-hole,AITA for yelling at my aunt after she kept pressuring me to marry her son,"I'm 24F from Pakistan, here cousin marriages are common and my aunt keeps pressuring me to marry her son (25M) since I was a teen. This started in my teen years. My aunt would start making jokes such as ""You'd make a good daughter in law"" or ""You and (her sons name) would make a good couple"" etc.

I used to brush it off back then, ignore it and such hoping it would stop but they never did. Instead it started being more common. She started doing it every time we met and I've shut her down politely every time saying I'm not interested and it wont ever happen

My mom knew how much it bothered me. She didn't want to disrespect her elders so she kept quiet and only spoke about it in private when my aunt messaged her. My mom told me to keep quiet and ignore because she wont let it happen

This was very uncomfortable. This whole thing gave my cousin some wrong ideas because he started messaging me in private saying things like ""We're getting married in the future so why aren't you talking to me now?"" I'd just ghost him and ignore his messages.

Just a few years ago. I lost my temper at a family gathering after my aunt said  ""You're all grown up now, when are you going to marry him? Our decision is final"". The strong feeling of ick and cringe just made me lash out. I yelled at my aunt calling her stupid for not listening to me and not understanding what no means. I used mild swear words as well and it was a whole heated argument.

To end the argument my brother had to physically carry me out of the house, where I had a breakdown and we all just left her house. My mom was hurt by this a lot and I could feel the pain in her voice whenever we spoke about this. She said she just wishes I handled it differently. 

After this came a series of unwanted toxicity and drama. My aunt yelled at my mom making her look like a terrible person for letting that happen and cut off all ties. She influenced moms oldest sister and brother to do the same. 

My cousin got married to someone else and we found out about it through someone else. He got married and divorced just later that year and some how my aunt managed to partially blame me and mom for that divorce even though we played no part in it. 

My mom deals with her siblings often and sometimes they drag her into dramas. I've seen her cry in her room alone because of this and it makes me feel bad. I feel like I should have done better or done things differently for the sake of my mom. All this toxicity and drama would have been avoided if I did things different."
158,1jvynef,Not the A-hole,WIBTA - Baby shower Drama with in Laws?,"Edit: when I say “gender reveal party” we took 6 people cupcakes and let the nieces bite into them. It was not an actual party lol, just immediate family. 

My husband and I got married back in June solely to have a baby. We’ve gone through infertility for two years and had multiple surgeries. When I got married I told everyone I’d have a wedding but there would be no baby shower. I get overstimulated and don’t particularly like being the center of attention. The reason we had the wedding was to make everyone else happy. I don’t regret the wedding, but I’m standing firm on the no baby shower now that we are pregnant. 

My mom told me my sister in law is planning us a baby shower after I told her no at least 10 times. We also told her not to tell anyone we were pregnant when we told family at 8w, but she immediately texted family asking if they knew the good news. After our gender reveal we still hadn’t told all of my family I was pregnant and she posted pictures from the gender reveal party decorations. I don’t want to hurt her feelings at all as I understand she’s excited, but I feel like if I go to the baby shower I will be letting my boundaries get walked all over. She’s saying it’s going to be a surprise to my mom. I told her I’d go shopping with just my husbands immediate family but no way were we having a baby shower. I suspect the baby shower will be after we go shopping. Should I just say I don’t feel good and drive separately and then go home avoiding the baby shower? I know I’ll be the bad guy for not going, but I’ve told them over and over I didn’t want a baby shower as I hate events like that. I also told them to donate the money they’d spend on the baby seeing my husband and I are financially stable. We do not want gifts as I was a nanny for 7 years and know that most of the baby stuff on the market is a scam, and we do not want a bunch of clutter. "
159,1jvxxyt,Asshole,AITA for refusing to write a frontend for my uncle's startup?,"(Note: This post will contain a lot of technical details)

I (25M) have been having a lot of trouble finding and holding a job. I am diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome and have been suffering from depression for most of my life. I love to code but due to the multiple disabilities the job search has been an uphill battle, and the pandemic and the war didn't help.

So my Uncle (51) doesn't know how to code. Recently the AI boom has gotten him motivated to join a startup as a marketer.

Now here's where I come in. My Uncle sent me a Whatsapp message asking me for help.

>If done successfully it may lead to a job, we have some investors interested but we need to move faster than we are moving right now with developing the MVP of our app.

I am an extremely slow coder so ""moving faster"" isn't my forte. He wants a frontend based on a design. I can do that. Here's where the red flags started to show up.

One of the things he specified is that it has to be written in ""IDEs like Cursor"". I understand that a team using the same tool will cooperate better ~~but I also feel like this is extremely belittling to nitpick my IDE choice. Am I alone on this?~~ (Edit: I understand now that I was being stubborn about the Cursor thing, especially because I use VS Code and Cursor is a fork of it, so it's really not that much of a difference.)

Another thing was that he mentioned that another team already tried to write the UI and failed. And he thinks I would do a better job. I only learned frontend development a few months ago. Why does he think I can do a better job than professionals is beyond me.

Eventually I agreed/was pressured to agree to write a frontend the best that I can to see how I do. Oh I immediately regretted it. My Uncle sent me the ""design"" and it was literally a powerpoint presentation with screenshots of websites in them. That's it.

After asking questions about the design. I got a sample of the backend data and oh boy. So it's all in JSON, but the JSON doesn't contain enough information for the frontend. Instead the backend sends an HTML field as a string to the frontend that I assume I am expected to render along with Javascript code I am supposed to run. What the fuck? But again, the entire point of asking me for help was to ""Move fast"" and I am currently slowing everything down because of me nitpicking the backend.

Now here's where I might be the asshole. I told my uncle that I will not be able to write the frontend. My dad called me out on it. Saying that I can just follow the design the best I can even if it's not detailed and to just work with the backend format. My mom thinks I should be nicer to my uncle and said she feels like she might be enabling my laziness. I owe her a lot and I really don't want to disappoint her.

I think I am the asshole. But I really can't write my uncle an intentionally broken frontend without it weighing on my conscience. Am I the Asshole?

TL;DR I am an unemployable programmer and I have been asked by my non-programmer uncle to write a frontend which ""may lead to a job"". After I said I can't really help due to an issue with the design and backend I got called out as the asshole by both my parents.

Edit:  lot of people expressed concern for my lack of progress in the job hunt or my lack of programming skill. As for the programming skill, I am extremely critical of my own ability but I have been assured from multiple directions it is more than sufficient to hold a junior position, including from the previously mentioned father. I call myself a ""slow programmer"" but the better term might be ""1X Programmer with an issue with perfectionism"". I understand that I am extremely lucky to have a supportive family that are letting me take as much time as I need to find a job and I can't thank them enough for it. not many people have that luxury. Someone in the comments called me an ""exhausting person to deal with"". That is true, but I have been seriously working on it. I need a lot of help I can't deny it and I have been bouncing between all sorts of bootcamps and job hunting courses for autists and neurotypicals alike and they have all been... well... utter trash.

  
Edit 2: Does nobody on this subreddit understand what a favor is? I really don't expect my uncle to pay for my crappy frontend. Especially not one I can't even write due to the previously mentioned problems. If he asked me to write the whole startup then I would ask for money. I don't even expect it to really result in a job like he thinks it would. 

Even if I got paid I can't really write anything with this terrible design and API. At least not something anyone would actually want to actually present to investors. "

161,1jvxbfi,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my closest friend I got close with someone else(FAKE NAMES),"I (15F) have 2 close friends who are my age. One of them(call her Mia) I made friends with her on my first day when I joined the school Oct 2023 and the other I became friends with that following Christmas. The problem is that ""Mia"" takes almost everyday off school and doesn't reply to messages and we don't hang out often outside school, I'm still really close with her but I barely see her. My other friend that I met Christmas 2023 (call her Emma) she is always in school and we message and go out all the time. The three of us have a gc and me and ""Emma"" never private chat but ""Mia"" never replies or reads the messages. 

Now the important part is that I told ""Emma"" a secret that ""Mia"" already knew I just forgot to tell ""Emma"". This was at lunch when we were all together. Anyway after I told ""Emma"" the secret I go, ""Don't tell anyone cuz you're my closest friend"". ""Mia"" gets mad and says that she knew me for longer and me and her are closer. I tell her that since you are always off school and when we text and try make plans you never go(from her own choice) and never reply. I told her that I don't purposely try to ""leave her out"" or make a ""duo in a trio"" but I don't really hang out with you(Mia) as much as Emma. She got mad and told me I'm ""selling her out"" and trying to make her left out. She said I'm being a fake friend and trying to kick her out the friend group. 

She has now left the gc and she won't hangout with me or ""Emma"". I have tried my best to include her but I still feel bad. AITA for getting close with someone else?? "

We are very similar, in fact, my other BFF jokes we're the same person. One day Yena just stopped answering my calls and messages. She talks to everyone but me. She shared with another friend it was weird that Levi and I had become close and she thought it was unrequited love on my part! I didn't even initiate a friendship with him!

163,1jvx6vj,Asshole,AITA for saying my BF's relationship with his ex's son inappropriate?,"AITA for thinking my BF's (31) relationship with his ex's kid is inappropriate?

so we've been dating for like a 4 months and early on my BF mentioned that he's still in contact with his ex gf's son (9). They've been split up for over  a year now and dated for almost 3. 

at first i thought it was kinda cute thinking they have a facetime like once a month or something, but turns out they meet like every other week for a dinner or going to the park etc (with the mom ofc). and ever since im spending more time with him, i found that they speak on the phone sporadically throughout the week.

now i'm all for a child having a good role model but am i crazy for thinking my BF shouldnt let the boy be too attached to him? First of all, some people might get the wrong idea about their dynamic like finding it kinda creepy for a grown unrelated man to be spending so much time with a kid. Plus people might think him and his ex are still a thing.

There's also the attachment angle that might be a problem in the future like what if we have our own kids and then he has to juggle his attention between all of them? Thats not fair to any of those kids. Also what if the ex eventually finds her own partner and then the stepdad doesnt want my BF in the picture? its gonna hurt them sooner or later if they drift apart.

I brought all of this up to him a few days ago and he went upset and said im overthinking all of it. He's since been rather cold towards me and not really returning my text saying he's busy with work but he's never been so slumped at work before that he ignores me all day, so he might be making an excuse?

so AITA?

edit/update: 

so after reading pretty much all of the comments its damn obvious that i was crossing the line making comments and unsolicited opinions on the nature of his relationship with the boy. after work i invited him to dinner at my place intending to apologise and i also took time to reflect the nature of our relationship and wanted to discuss it with him.

so we had the talk and i did apologise for everything i said and he took it well. he explained that he definitely feels fatherly towards Damien (pseudonym) because prior to meeting him he was sure he didnt want kids. that was a good segway into talking about his plans for the future. 

he said he still does see a future with us together as well as Damien still remaining in his life, with our own kids if that's on the table. but he assures me that i would not have to play a role of ""stepmom"" if i dont want to. in fact he wasnt expecting me to even meet Damien in the first place and he just wanted me to know that the boy was an active part of his life. i asked him wouldnt that make him live a double life of sorts and he said its not really a problem for him.

i brought up that this might cause him having to split time and attention and he said that Damien would naturally get busier as he grows older with school, his own interest and whatnot and that it wouldnt really effect me or any potential family in the long run. i suppose thats true enough

in the end we sorta made up i think and he's talking again like usual. but i did tell him i need time to process all of this and he was very understanding about it. he assures me that he's still looking forward for a future for us together and i do feel like maybe we can work things out. only time can tell

164,1jvvzjd,Asshole,AITA for talking behind my friend back ?,"
In my friend group we are 7 - 8 but not everyone is friend the same way. There is this guy (lets call him friend A) that is kinda friend with everyone but not rly. He could leave the group tomorow and never talk to anyone and not care exept for 1 guy (lets call him friend B). Friend B is super friend with everyone me included. The problem is A friend is friendly and funny with us but he only ever comes if B friend is here, and you can tell even tho he is funny and friendly he dont give a shit about everyone else. He never rly did anything that bad towards any of us but you can tell he dont rly like us. I tried very hard to be really friend with him and go towards him but he still dont give a shit about me. Now we are at a point where i openly speak bad about him to m'y other friends when he is not here but i kinda feel bad about it because he never rly did anything bad towards me personnaly. AITH for speaking bad behind his back for this reason ? Just because he only like friend B and not everyone else ?"

I ended up meeting her and we went out a few times when I found out that she was getting out of a toxic relationship where he beat her and she was pregnant with his child. She ended up moving into an apartment and on her first day in the house we ended up having our first night. We continued together for a month making plans for the future. When her boyfriend said he still loved her, she got back together with him and broke up with me. A year later she sent me a message and we started talking again because I still love her. She came to my city and we started dating again and started planning to settle down and bring her son to start a family. So I introduced her to my family and friends and we made plans again.

166,1jvvv62,Not the A-hole,AITA for accepting to move into an apartment my girlfriend's parents bought?,"Hi,

I've been dating for around 7 years. The relationship has been great and me and my girlfriend love eachother very much. Obviously these past few years now that we are reaching close to 25 and have stable jobs and are out of uni we want to move in. Her parents originally had offered that we could move into an old apartment they rent out, which would need ample renovations, my parents at the time agreed with this and said they'd cover the renovation cost. Fast forward a few months and her dad asks her if we would prefer to move into a new apartment, as he is considering buying a new construction as an investment but would rather we live there than getting rent money. My girlfriend said sure but said she'd talk with me to see how I felt about it. Personally I saw no issue with this even if I felt a bit overwhelmed at the gesture. I explained the change in the situation to my mom who said they'd cover for furniture in that case and things seemed ok. A few weeks pass and the first issue arises, as she doesn't feel comfortable with it, says we (or my girlfriends parents) should have talked with her about potentially splitting the apartment cost etc. Since then she has stated she won't ever visit as she doesn't want to visit someone else's apartment and won't feel comfortable doing so, mind you my girlfriends parents have literally told us the house is ours, yet my mom refuses to acknowledge this and always calls it as my girlfriends parents house.

She's now mad at me over a second discussion that happened yesterday about this that boiled down to me saying I understand your feelings but I don't have the same opinion. Her getting mad. Delving into a shouting match.

Some of her points are:
-I won't feel comfortable coming over;
-So what, you won't ever live in your own house?
-I feel like I won't see you again.

A few other factors:
-Despite saying she'd help with furniture she hasn't for the past 6 months, and I or my girlfriend won't bring it up as we feel it'd be rude.
-If a conversation about this or anything else she doesn't agree with doesn't go directly at the other person agreeing with her she yells and gets mad, I'm not hotheaded but if you yell at me I wind up yelling back.

There's probably a lot more I didn't cover quite frankly I'm just tired, if you have any questions ask away and I'll edit the post.

167,1jvt2yw,Asshole,AITA FOR REFUSING TO APOLOGIZE FIRST AND DEMANDING AN APOLOGY,"My partners roommate (brother/nephew) has a very destructive dog and has destroyed/damaged multiple things of mine and my partners, including furniture/stuff for my dog and peed in shoes (his dog is a Belgian malinois to give an understanding of how bad the destruction can get) and he doesn’t train her and doesn’t take her outside. 

He instead decides to play video games or go on TikTok live as soon as he gets off work and puts pee pads down for her in the morning It all stays in the living room for everybody to deal with but him and when it’s bought up then he walks her and continues the habits the next day his excuse is he’s to tired from work but will come back home after a 10 hour shift and game till 3am and often leave the poop and pee their for days. 

The current issue is i finally exploded at him and I’ll admit I said some very mean/sensitive things with zero thought that had nothing to do with the current issue everytime I’m told to be quiet (by my partner)and my partner will handle it which he does and replaces my stuff (my partner replaces or cleans my stuff not the roommate) and it does stress my partner a lot and it upsets me to see him like that but I’ve been told to keep quiet so I did, well this past year we had our trip cut short(my birthday gift/valine’s gift cause both are close) cause they were moving apartments and the roommate didn’t want to clean the apartment (mess his dog created and him and partner had an agreement) and instead we had to drive back and my partner had to clean in the dark and I refused to help cause I had been extremely mad and didn’t want help Last night was probably our biggest one yet where I said things with zero thought or relevance to the issue and was extremely mean and out of line I’ll admit I was out of line (I told my partner that to) but I feel as though my feelings were valid (not my comments obviously I was enraged) but the cycle happened again expect this time I was asked to apologize first by my partner even though his roommates irresponsibly and lack of control over her 3 yr old dog caused this from the start I’ll apologize but only if he apologizes first is what I said

168,1jvsrct,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my boyfriend mom that I would cover or remove my tattoo of a man’s name?,"For context, I (21 f) have a tattoo of my died family members names on my shoulder. I also have other tattoos on my body again also could be hidden by clothing. My boyfriend family has known me for a few years and I expect to his mother that I have tattoos. She was very kind about it and I had even showed her a few of them. My boyfriend (23 m) took me out to a restaurant that was near a beach. I was wearing what I would call a beach outfit of course that means you could see my shoulders. My boyfriend took a picture of me and posted it. My shoulder tattoos were visible and you could see a few names of my family members and next to one of them had a heart and a mushroom. 

The next day I had to meet up with my boyfriend and his family for dinner. During the dinner his mother asked me about the tattoos and I showed her then proceeded to ask me to remove and or cover one of them up with makeup. I was shocked as she points at the on with the heart and mushroom next to it. As it insinuate that I might still be in love with this man as he is the only one that doesn’t have a last name next to it instead. I tried explaining that the name is of my died brother who died 4 years ago and the heart was that I missed him and the mushroom was also tattooed because he loved them growing up. But she kept interrupting me and even look at my boyfriend saying that he should have dated me seeing that I had tattoo of another man name on my body instead of his. This is where I think I might be the asshole I had just walked out of the house immediately after she said that, saying that maybe she would know why I have “another man name on my body” instead of my boyfriend’s since that name has more meaning than she actually thinks. 

After walking out I just drove to my brother grave that is a hour away from where I live. My boyfriend had text me through out the time I was driving. I had just sent me my location so he wouldn’t go to my parent’s house looking for me. A few hours after arriving to he had call me saying that he just had an argument with his mom and I had felt like it was my fault for him having to argue with her because of me and if my parents didn’t mind to stay at my house just until his parents calm down. 

It’s been a week since that incident and his mom finally agreed to have a conversation with me and even agreed to have the conversation with my boyfriend in the room. I explain to her that it was my brother’s name, I had it since I had turn 18, would not be covering it up with makeup or even consider removing it. I didn’t show her due to the fact everyone always feels pity for me, even ask me how he died, and that is why I don’t have a date under his to his name. She argued with me that telling her would have been easier and making more excuses for her actions. My boyfriend and a few of our close friends are on my side but his family and other friends agree that I should have told her that it was a tattoo of my brother name. So AITA?"
169,1jvrfjg,Not the A-hole,AITA for not moving out from my room,"Basically, i and my roommate live in a hostel with 2 floor,mine is it on the 1st floor. Here temprature gets too hot in summer. My roommate is not used to this temprature so he is installing AC with his friend who lives on the 2nd floor. Now my roommate wants me to move to his friend room so that he could install AC in our room, but i don't want to because the above floor gets direct sunlight and gets too hot, while lower floor is relatively cold. Since he is installing AC i suggested him to move to upper floor. Not to mention that i don't want to shift upward as only 2 month remains of the contract.

170,1jvr5f0,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for taking back bamboo poles someone used from the community garden?,"I have a small vegetable patch in a community garden run by the city. I recently collected a bunch of bamboo poles to build support for my plants — I carried them quite a long way by foot and went to a spot where I knew someone had recently cut bamboo, so I could trim and take some. It took a fair amount of effort.

I left the poles on the fence next to my plot for a couple of days while I got ready to use them, and today I noticed a few (about four) were stuck into someone else's garden bed. I’m guessing they either thought it was communal or didn’t think much before taking them. But still — they weren’t in a shared pile or anything. They were clearly right next to my patch.

I’m planning to take them back and leave a polite note saying I brought them from home and need them. There’s also a WhatsApp group for the garden, but it’s not very active, and I don’t really know the people well, so I feel awkward making a public message out of it.

Now I’m wondering… am I being petty? Should I just let it go? I feel like I’ll be judged for not being generous or for making a fuss over something small, but on the other hand, it’s a public space where everyone takes care of their own patch. I haven’t taken or gotten anything from anyone there, and I really will need the poles.

She asked me to make the promise due to the time and cost involved with transporting and taking care of her three youngest children for a destination wedding.

My fiancé is her firstborn and she loves him to absolute death. He'd be the first of her children to get married and it feels like it would be a dick move to deny her the privilege of seeing him enter into matrimony, but he's down to get married anywhere, leaving this decision up to me.

I primarily want to have it be just the two of us because I don't want to get involved with of all of the fuss, pomp, circumstance, and cost that goes into a traditional wedding, but also because I have exactly enough money for my dream wedding in Vegas. 

Would I be an asshole if broke my promise and went to Vegas?"

Well we've lived there a year and finally someone called on these losers for having all their cars parked in front of other people's houses for a week at a time! 

My loser neighbor comes over and accuses me of calling and says ""we've never had a problem here before"". I  told him it wasn't us but he would t listen. So I shut the door right in his face.

Later my wife becomes  paranoid that everyone in the neighborhood now thinks it was us and we are going to be the pariahs of the neighborhood. She even texted the loser to apologize and reiterate it wasn't us. 

I feel like giving that guy a piece of my mind, and telling him never come back to my house, and don't ever park in front of my house again for more than 48 hours. He has some nerve disturbing my peace and trying to make his problem my problem. Am I the asshole?"

I suggested things we could do and she said she doesn't know yet she wants to visit her old roommates but also texted two other people who haven't replied yet. So basically if they don't answer we can do something. Honestly, I feel used. She doesn’t plan to spend any time with me but sleep at my apartment. I knew/thought she wanted to meet up with as many people as possible but I thought we'd also spend some time together.

174,1jvql8z,Not the A-hole,AITA for implying my flatmate's friend might be creep?,"Hi everyone! 
Me (21F) and my flatmate (20F) (let's call her ""L"") live together in a flat owned by my L's parents in our university town. The university town is about an hour away from our hometown both by car and train. Me and my flatmate are high school friends and we usually have no problems with living together (except for like little annoyances, but most of them are like ""please don't use the microwave after midnight, it's really loud and I'm trying to sleep""). 
However, she has a habit of letting her friends sleep over in our couch and usually, she only tells me by texting ""oh I promised XY they can sleep on our couch, I hope it's okay🥺"" on the day before or something. And while usually I'm annoyed by it (I am autistic and these kind of kinda sudden changes stress me out), I'm like okay, because I know those people, they're usually our high school friends. Also, I don't like confrontation (something I'm working on), so I haven't said anything. 
But she has a ""friend"" (early 30sM) who asks to sleep on our couch for a few nights by once a semester and usually, I just commute on those days. This friend is a priest, he was L's youth pastor. Now, while I did went to religious high school, I'm not religious and I just find it weird why a 30 something guy would want to sleep on the couch on two young adult girls' couch. If he were in town for official bussiness, I'm sure the church would provide him with accomodations (and probably even if he were here on private bussiness) or if he's here for other things, why can't he just find accomodations with other people? Also, as I said our hometown is only an hour away by both car and train, so it's not like it's such a long commute. 
Anyways, I think my friend finally caught on how I'm always commuting or skip my classes on days when he's here and she asked me why was I never sleeping in the flat when the priest is there. And I just told her how I think it's truly weird that a grown man would choose to sleep in our flat (btw, he first slept here when we were both 18), that I do not feel comfortable with him in the flat (the couch is in the living room and my bedroom opens into it. I have to go through it to get basically anywhere) and that I think it's creepy that his first choice for accomodation is my friend. Honestly, this was the first time I ever said anything about this and my friend got upset that I implied his friend would do anything bad or be a creep towards us. And the few times I slept there when the priest was over, he did nothing to make me uncomfortable or anything. 
Anyways, am I the asshole?

175,1jvqkir,Not the A-hole,AITA for scolding my mom for organising a bday party for me,"I turned 23 on 10th of April. For context I live with my parents and sister in a small flat. I’m studying on weekends, working full time on weekdays and after work I’m working on my final college project which is really big and requires a lot of work. I’m disabled and constant work exhausts me, to the point I barely talk to anyone. Additionally April is a very bday heavy month for my family. 8th is my cousin's bday, 9th my grandpa's, 10th mine and my uncle’s and 12th another cousin's. Often we meet up 2 times only to check down two bday's in one day.

Few weeks before my bday I went to my parents to ask them not to organise any party for me for my bday as on 10th I'll be at work till evening and after work I will be too tired to sit with the guests, and instead I rather work on my project, which they know is a lot of work and I’m very behind with the progress. Besides that it’s common knowledge in our family I’m not that big on celebrating my bdays. I proposed that the guests can just send me a message or visit our home in the afternoon, just to not expect me to be there as I’ll be at work. I say this since family gatherings are mostly to catch up with other family members more than to celebrate the occasion itself.

They said they will inform whoever plans to visit.

On the 9th of April I had home office which I fully dedicated to my college project. Because it was my grandpa's bday I sent him a text since I couldn't go with my parents to the church. I had to be visible online for my boss till 5pm. Knowing I wouldn't leave my room and was gonna work till night I didn't really take care of my looks or my room. My parents knew of my plans and knew not to disturb me because I lose focus really easily. 

Somewhere after my work hours, while I was still working on my project, a bunch of people got into my room singing happy birthday. I was confused.

Turns out my parents decided to organise a surprise party because “I’ve been so stressed and overworked recently they thought they would invite everyone the day I'm home so I could have a drink with them and not worry about work or school.”

I just snapped and cursed at my mom about how I literally told them I didn't want any guests because I don’t even have time. Our flat is tiny so all the guests heard every cuss word I threw at them. At the end I was still forced to sit with the guests and later babysit my cousins in my room as they played.

After guests left my dad came into my room to scold me for embarrassing them in front of everyone. I heard that I didn’t deserve to have that party in the first place if I can’t appreciate so many people coming to visit me so late in the day, during my grandpa's bday, and that everyone else also has their jobs and families to take care of, so I’m not that special for feeling tired.

I feel like I really should have kept the anger to myself or at least say how I feel in private instead of shouting in the open. AITA?"
176,1jvqj6u,Asshole,AITA who won’t let my boyfriend attend a party,"So my boyfriend (40) got invited to a kids party from a long time family friend. This family friend has a sister who lives out of state and let’s name her Lucy(38) for the sake of it. So Lucy is coming to her sister’s son’s bday party and I’m divide between attending the party with my boyfriend or letting him go alone or attending at all. 

A little back story, my boyfriend has known Lucy and her family all their lives they were neighbors all their childhood and adulthood. Lucy has 3 kids with her boyfriend who they have been on and off a couple times and my boyfriend has no kids. My boyfriend and I have been together 2 years and I always felt like there was something more than just a friendship between them and every time I would ask him about it he would just say they are really good friends and that he knows them all his life but something never sat well with me. 

She would just move out of state a little before me and him got together maybe  3years ago and has not come to visit ever since. Anyway Lucy and my boyfriend would always message and talk to each other through txt Snapchat and IG and when I started to suspect something I started going through his phone and their messages they had together( which knew about). Some of them were just like “hi how you been” but most of them were her asking money  to go to Starbucks, McDonald’s or back to school shopping, the kids bdays  and Xmas, mind knew that she lives with the  kids father and  she has never worked a day in her life and is always asking everyone in her family and my boyfriend for money. 

My boyfriend would send her money all the time  because he “would feel bad for the kids”. He is attached to her daughters and son the youngest daughter is really attached to him she is 10. she always txt him or FaceTime him to talk 3-4 times a week. He always send them gift for their bdays and Xmas.  

fast forward  I am currently pregnant and I told him a little lie to see what he tell me . I told him that someone informed me that Lucy and him had a sexual relationship and that he lied about just being friends to me in the past and I gave him an ultimatum and informed him that if he lied to me once  more our relationship was over he confirm the affair and told me it happened after she had her first child which was like 15 years ago and that it lasted 3 year he swore up and down that it ended and never again did he sleep with her after it ended which I believe. I also told him that he could no longer be friends with her he deleted her and blocked her from EVERYWHERE and I made sure of it. IG, SC, FB His Phone, email and even TIKTOK she is blocked and deleted. So now that I know what happened and she is coming to the party AITA for not wanting to attend such party or him to attend at all. "
177,1jvq5hs,Everyone Sucks,AITA for insisting that we should rehome our dog?,"I (21) live with my mother and stepfather, and we got a golden retriever over a year ago. Now, I wasn't supportive of the decision in the first place- I'm a cat person, and two dogs (a dorkie, and a senior golden we honestly weren't expecting to still have around by now) is more than enough for me. My mother works from home and already worked overtime before we got the dog, and my stepdad is rarely ever home. He insisted he'd take care of the dog- I knew damn well that the responsibility would fall on my mother. Surprise surprise, it did. And sure, I may take every opportunity to say ""I told you so""

This dog is a terror on our household. He's a high energy dog in a household of low energy people. He's destructive, steals everything, and barks at anything that moves. He'll still poop and pee inside, despite having learned to go outside a long time ago. On top of all that, he's a 90lb dog with no spatial awareness that barrels everyone over. He even sprained my mother's wrist. He shows signs of being a good dog, but those times are too few and far between.

I've been convinced that the only good solution is to rehome him for a year. Both me and my mother would dread coming home to the dog, and it hasn't improved since. But my mother has always looked down on rehoming pets, finding it cruel to make a pet lose the family it's known its whole life. This dog has ""made her understand why people do it"". She still refuses to actually consider it. I get the sentiment, but the kindness of it is overridden by the fact that his family is never happy to see him.

My mother regularly ends up screaming at the dog because she gets so overwhelmed by him throughout the day. She physically cannot control him. My stepfather is the only one who actually wants the dog. And he doesn't let things go when they need to be, so it'd be hopeless to convince him. Which is probably partially why my mother doesn't consider the idea of rehoming.

Today, she had another fit because the dog had acted out all day- screaming about how much she hates the dog and is sick of having pets. I commented how rehoming him would fix that. She defensively snapped at me with the idea of giving away my cat [the best behaved animal in the house, mind you.] As if I'd made the comment about HER dog (the dorkie) and not the dog that she was just screaming her hatred of. I have no idea why she took it so personally. 

I haven't said much on their stances, because I can't understand them. I don't understand how my mother can be so offended by the idea of rehoming a dog she hates. Or how my stepdad can disregard our grievances with the dog- or be bothered by the fact that his dog nearly broke his wife's wrist. Am I just too logic-driven to understand the emotional side? Because imo, prioritizing their emotions when the situation is so bad is what's selfish. Sure, the dog may mellow out eventually, but is that possibility really worth it? "

the issue is that I purchased us concert tickets two months ago (finn wolfhard is the musician btw) under the pretense of bringing Gracie but I don't really want to anymore because she's been very awkward since the break-up, and it seems like she doesn't want me around

the problem with uninviting Gracie is that a week after the concert we are going on a school trip that would involve us staying in the same dorm room for a week and i don't want it to be Graciewkward between us

if i did uninvite her id bring a friend of mine who actually likes finn wolfhard's music because my ex only really wanted to go for me and actually doesn't like the music at all

But it just seems very weird that he has attempted to call the dog away from me more than 5 five times.   It's even weirder/funnier that the dog hasn't obeyed him once while with me.  I don't even tell the dog ""No"" or like ""Stay"".  
Once I got home and the dog was spending time with him in the kitchen (not a problem for me) but I instinctively call my dog over and my friend goes and says ""what did you call him over or take him away, I was spending time with him?"" Or something to that effect.   He seemed kinda annoyed that I did that.   So I said with a puzzled face ""because he's my dog"", to which he replied ""ahhh ok, than I won't feed your dog when you ask me to"".   If I'm working late I would call my Roomate to feed him as a favor.   
I thought my roommate would stop once he got himself a puppy.  I was wrong.   He doesn't do it as much but it still happens from time to time.  
AITA for thinking he's being a dick by this behavior in trying to call my dog over away from me.  I have never done this to him with his dog nor with any friend or family member.   My gut feels like he's trying to be Alpha of the house, but doing this.   This is irritating to me as I feel it's stupid especially when I have been friends with the guy since high school.
What do ya'll think?  Any opinions or similar experiences you guys have had with something like this? "
180,1jvpk3l,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving my roommate?,"I became friends with this girl and a few months later we were talking about rooming together. We talked about me renting my room/subleasing throughout the year for personal reasons. We found a place we were happy with. 6 weeks in I reminded her I’ll be looking for someone to sublease my room. I asked her if she had any requirements for a roomie. She said they should be clean and respectful. I found a male vouched for by an acquaintance of my roommates. I asked if a male was okay, she said sure. I confirmed details with the potential sublessee, and once I told her she completely went back on everything we discussed. Instead of saying “hey, I thought about this and I don’t feel comfortable with this idea"", or ""I no longer want you to sublease your room out,” she started going off and yelling at me while I silently listened hoping she would want to have a civil conversation. I waited in silence, giving her a moment to collect her anger. The next day I asked her to simply have a conversation with the potential sublessee and if she wasn’t comfortable, I’d tell him no. Instead, she blackmailed me by emailing me a document that requested a guarantor on our lease. And then proceeded to say she won’t have the conversation until I signed. And then said she would not allow anyone to move in. She then tells the landlord to which he refused a sublessee. I accepted his refusal. All this happened within 2 hours. I went back to my apartment, grabbed some personal items, and locked my door on my way out. When I returned that night, my room was unlocked. I really felt like I could not trust her so I decided I needed to move out. I didn’t even feel like I needed to tell her anything. I felt that if I did, she would do something unpredictable again. Before I could return for the rest of my stuff, she changed the locks on the door. I reached out to the landlord and I learned he was aware! I told the landlord I was moving out. I offered to help find a replacement to which my roommate refused my help. And now she is asking me to pay rent. How am I supposed to pay rent for an apartment I was locked out of?

AAITA for leaving my roommate with the lease after she illegally evicted me?"
181,1jvpjg0,Not the A-hole,AITA for moving my ex bsfs mom’s wet laundry?,"I (16F), my mom (36F), and my sister (13F) are currently living with my ex best friend (18F) and her mother (42F) after getting out of a really bad household. I met my ex best friend (we’ll call her Sav) around a year ago in my freshman year of highschool which she was a junior at the time. We became close really fast and I never suspected any hard feelings towards me or resent, it was smooth sailing.

In October of 2024 my family and I had to get out of a really bad situation, Sav and her mom (Amy) offered for us to stay until the end of the school year. I’m never in the house due to my relationship & gym which might’ve taken a toll on our friendship but we would always keep communication. Everything in the house was going great up until December of 2024, in which I noticed really awful comments towards me (Ex: “why are you fatter than your boyfriend?”) along with taking my things when I’m not home such as my makeup and clothes. I made it clear to her that this took a massive toll on our friendship but I will try my hardest to build my trust with her again since I didn’t want to lose her. After this she started taking her anger out on me and throwing anything she could find towards me. I thought this behavior was okay at first, she made me feel as if I deserved it but after talking with my therapist I realized that I should set a clear boundary on we should treat each other with respect. 
Soon after, she completely stopped talking to me so I gave up on giving all of my energy into our friendship when I’ve been nothing but disrespected the past few months. I thought that this would be okay.. until she started sneaking into my room and stealing all of my mothers money that she’s been saving for us to move out, my personal belongings, and any alcohol in the house. At first I expressed concern until she lied to my mother and I’s face about everything, so my mother tried to bring it to Amy but she said that I’m a “disgusting, disrespectful, and lying bi***”. 

Following this situation, little things started to happen from both Amy and Sav. More money went missing, they’re taking my food (I need gluten free food as I have celiac disease), and they’re taking all of my sugar free drinks because I can’t handle a lot of sugar. Then Amy started making me do her laundry right before I went to bed, I let this happen for a few weeks but one day I took her wet laundry and put it on her bed because I was so exhausted. I wasn’t able to get any sleep.

The following day, I get berated from both Amy and Sav for me moving the laundry. I admitted to doing it and I apologized profusely but they’re now openly crap talking me in the house and Sav is now spreading all of my personal information around school. I’m now being heavily bullied for my childhood trauma, my appearance, and how I dress. I’m starting to think that I went too far.

AITA for moving the wet laundry after getting fed up?

182,1jvpdhc,Not the A-hole,AITA for opting to stay home from an event involving my bf and his friends?,"Everyone involved is in our early 20's.
I've been with my bf for a little over a year now and we hang out with his friends more than mine, due to distance and availability. His friends are nice, I get along with them fine, just one girl (let's call her Anna) comes off as a pick-me, in my opinion.
She's loud, complains a lot and has a habit of touching my bf and the other males in the group on their arms, backs etc, she even has a pet name for my bf.

She is perfectly nice to me, but we never talk about anything more than the usual small talk. There were 1 or 2 instances in the past where i felt she crossed boundaries, for eg leaving her clothes in my bf's apartment when he let her shower in there when her hot water wasn't working (he was not there, he was back home for a few days visiting his parents). Amongst other small things that just add up over time to irk me.

I mention it to my bf every time and he is always kind and patient, I trust him completely and know that he has never crossed his limits, and has even spoken to her about it in the past. I do not doubt him, but I am beginning to lose my patience.

Next week we are all supposed to go to a cabin to spend the weekend, but when I learned she was coming yesterday, I told my boyfriend I don't want to go anymore. I told him that he could go since it's his friends but I don't want to smile and laugh and tolerate her.

My bf is now mad at me and says I'm being controlling and that I'm supposed to be there for him, and not bother with anyone else. He gave me an ultimatum, which is show up or he needs space for a few days. AITA for wanting to stay home?

TLDR; I chose not to go to a group event with my bf and his friends bc one of them gets on my nerves."
183,1jvp4on,Not the A-hole,AITA for going into detail of my shitty day to make a Mother piss off and leave me alone?,"I'm writing this with a bit of a cooler head than earlier in the day and wondering if maybe i'd gone too far, my boyfriend certainly thinks so.  

I (22F) have blonde hair that goes past my hips, I love my hair and put a lot of work into maintaining it but you can imagine the comments I sometimes get being compared to Rapunzel etc, and normally I laugh this off and if it's a little kid I indulge them more often than not as it's cute. 

I've had a really rough day, my 11 year old dog had to be put down due to cancer, and i'd went from the vets to a cafe not wanting to go home and see her things and be reminded of it all over again. So i'd been sitting at a table with a coffee waiting for my boyfriend (23M) to finish work to come and meet me when a mother and her daughter who looked about 8ish (idk i'm not good with kids ages it's a guestimate) came up to me and asked if her daughter could take a picture with me as I ""looked just like Rapunzel.""

As I said normally i'd indulge this but I was not in the mood, I was in a low mood and had been crying a lot so felt gross, I told them thank you for that compliment but I didn't want to take a picture. The Mother got really upset with me at that and told me I didn't have to be rude and how I didn't even smile, that it would cost me nothing to be nice and how her daughter was just a kid.

I admit I lost my temper with this and told her I wasn't a Disney Cast member for her to badger, that she asked and I said no. That I had just put my dog down and was hiding at this cafe as I was dreading going home to a house without my dog, that I had no interest in posing and putting on a happy face to take a picture with her child. I also started to cry again.

She got very flustered at this and rushed her child away. My boyfriend finally got to the cafe around half an hour later, and I told him what had happened and he told me I took it too far, that just because I was having a shitty day didn't mean I needed to make other peoples shitty. 

I ended up going home not long after. Maybe I was too rude idk. It's too late to do anything about it she was a stranger. I just feel raw emotionally, my boyfriend might be viewing my actions with a clearer head than me."
184,1jvok9u,Not the A-hole,AITA for expecting my partner to help out with rent?,"My (37 m) partner and I (35 f) have been together for almost 3 years. I have a daughter and he has no kids.When we met, I was still in nursing school, not working so I wasn't making any money. He knew this, and he has a pretty good job so he would pay for everything when we would go out. Shortly after we became official, he had me pay for some of the times we would go out, which is fine. I get it. It just kinda sucked because I was not working and short on money but it is what it is. 


Fastforward to now, I still pay for everything for my daughter and I don't mind that, it's my responsibility. We take turns paying for stuff when we go out so it's okay. 

He never officially moved in, but he slowly started staying over longer and longer. He hasn't stayed at his place in almost a year. He works as a lineman so he would travel around a lot. Didn't have an apartment but he has an RV he owns and pays $400 a month for the lot. I bought a house almost two years before we met and I pay almost $1200 in mortgage and all the bills are under my name, of course. I eventually talked him into helping me pay some of the bills since he hadn't offered. We came to an agreement that he would pay 1/3 since it's me and my daughter and it's just him with no kids, but he wasn't excited about that. He doesn't think he should help me pay for my mortgage at all because he says I'm the one building equity on it and when I sell it, the money will be mine. Which is true, but I don't think it's necessary fair. He makes pretty good money ($20/hr. more than me, to be exact) but still doesn't offer to pay for anything other than half of the times we go out. Whenever anything in the house needs fixing, I'm the one paying for it and he never offers to pay any part of it. WIBTA for asking again to give me some money for rent since he gets to live in my home?

ETA: he justifies not paying rent and only paying 1/3 of the bills since he now drives an hour to and from work and pays the extra gas it's costing him (his RV is an hour away, which is where his work is as well)."
185,1jvohtz,Everyone Sucks,AITAH FOR CALLING OUT MY FRIEND FOR HER BEHAVIOR?,"Sorry this is so long please bear with me.

Recently me and my best friend have been on a health journey. We were at the gym the other day talking about how many calories we should be eating, she was telling me it needs to be 1200 to lose weight. While I wasn’t disagreeing with her, I told her that that wouldn’t work for me and my body. I also confided in her about a binge eating problem I’ve had in the past. Things got kinda heated because she began to argue with me and tell me that’s why I wasn’t losing any weight. It felt was a little insensitive and hurt my feelings so I asked her to stop. She didn’t and continued until I told her to shut up. Things were awkward and she left. She texted me almost immediately kind of apologizing but not saying really saying I’m sorry and that she was just being a friend and telling me that because I always ask why I don’t lose weight (mind you I’m venting to her, I never once asked for her opinion about it) I told her that she really hurt my feelings and I needed space. She sent me some laughing emojis saying okay, then sent another message saying that she wouldn’t bring it up again because I was so sensitive about it. This REALLY hurt my feelings. I acted out of anger and blocked her because I just wanted her to stop. A few days later I reached out to her and once again, bring up how it made me feel and telling her that Id like an apology from her . She then tried to give me another apology this time saying “ I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings but also you shouldve handle the situation differently. I told her that that wasn’t a real apology. She then kind of gave me a half ass I’m sorry. I decided just to take it and move on. She came over yesterday, seemed tense but acted fine. Today she was still acting weird to me so I reached out today and asked her if everything was OK. She said that she felt like she was walking on eggshells around me. And she didn’t know what to say, and what not to say to me anymore. I felt like it was kind of a ridiculous thing to say. So I said maybe just don’t say hurtful things to me? She got upset by that too. I then was honest with her about how she’s been acting in general (she just had a baby a few months ago and I think she may have PPD) her moods have been really erratic and she’s been depressed a lot. I told her that I was worried for her, and asked that she talk to her therapist. She then really blew up on me and started saying that I also do manic things and say hurtful things to her and that I need to not talk to her like that. She then told me she couldn’t be my friend anymore. Honestly, I don’t understand what I did wrong. I tried really hard to properly communicate my feelings with her on the whole thing. And I feel like she’s maybe playing the victim about it? I also wanna add that this is an ongoing issue I’ve had with her about not apologizing for her behavior. I don’t know someone please tell me if I’m the asshole. I feel like I’m constantly having to apologize even when she hurts my feelings. "
186,1jvogn9,Asshole,AITA for waking up to check on a game,"For context, I’m into Rust this month and I’m trying to do an art museum using a script to paint complex scenes. My S.O knows that it’s something that really interests me. The issue is that the server restarts once a day and the paintings take so much time to complete that they overlap. The only solution I found is to wake up just before 5 a.m to pause it then go back to sleep. My S.O is very frustrated by that and is arguing non stop since then that I can’t do that, that I’m choosing a game over her. I don’t feel like it’s inherently wrong but I would like an outside perpective on the matter to know if IATA. 

Thank you for the help in advance.

Update : Said sorry for waking her up and we made up. Will look into other ways that doesn’t involve messing with her sleep. Thanks everyone who commented for your point of views on the matter."

188,1jvnkqw,Not the A-hole,AITA for snapping at my neighbor who has been complaining about weeds?,"I’ve lived in my neighborhood for 13 years, never had a single issue or complaint with anyone. Everyone out here is pretty cool and helped eachother. Our neighborhood has always had a population of around 180 or less until Covid. We have a sort of newish neighbor who is literally wealthy enough to live anywhere in town. Yet she chooses to move to a low-working class income neighborhood. She has been complaining about our yard because of “weeds” for the last year or so. Leaving us rude passive aggressive notes. 

My husband and I both work full time, and he has cancer. We do mowe the lawn when it gets talll enough for things like snakes and ticks- our area is woodsy and in north Fl. I told this woman to go moved to an HOA, she class-shamed us for being “renters” and said she is a home owner and that we need to care for our lawn. I told her to leave us alone and mind our business, and I wasn’t nice about it. I called them gentrifiers and that because of their complaints that they weren’t welcome here. 

Never been like that towards a neighbor but I’m so sick of her complaining to our landlords who have also had it with her. So, AITA? "

We’ve been together for only about 3 months, and she wants to go take the trip up to see her stepdad and his girlfriend. Also, my girlfriend mentioned the house is in “the middle of nowhere”. 
She asked me if I was excited about the trip. I replied, saying I was just a little sketched out staying with people I’ve never met in the middle of nowhere. 
She immediately laughed at me and said I was being ridiculous, obvoisly i got offended. After some back and forth, she said it was offensive because it was like if she said she wasn’t comfortable sleeping at my house. (I live 10 minutes from her and live at home.) It’s completely different, I tried explaining, but she doesn’t understand. 
Is this me? 
Do I need to grow up? 
Am I being a chicken? 
I don’t know.

190,1jvmalw,Not the A-hole,AITA For going to Thailand with my dad without my husband to spread my grandmas ashes?,"Some context, my dad was born in Thailand and immigrated to the states when he was 13. My grandma used to live in the states 6 months at a time. So she would live 6 months here and then 6 months there. 
Well she was diagnosed with cancer and unfortunately died here, state side. 
This was many years ago, and we haven’t been able to fly her ashes over to Thailand for financial reasons and also family drama (like my dad’s siblings were fighting for who’s to do it.) 

Well the time has finally come and he’s now taking on the responsibility and asked for me to come with him. My grandma has a whole estate in Thailand. She has a home in a village, a townhome in Bangkok and owns 80 acres of rice field that has been in my family since before I was even born. I should add I have a whole family that I haven’t met yet that’s been taking care of everything in her estate. 

When my dad asked me of course I said yes. This won’t be till next year when I graduate cosmetology school. So he wants to double this trip as a graduation present. I’ve also never left the country before so that’s also why this is a big deal. 

When I told my husband he immediately said he wanted to go and I told him it’s really not my trip to invite him on. Whenever I was speaking to my dad about the logistics of the trip he did mention unprompted he wanted it to just be us and next time we go then we can bring my husband. 

Well my husband is very upset and said that if the tables were turned he would have “stuck up for me” and that it’s kind of wack that he can’t experience something like this with me. It’s not like my dad was bashing him, so I didn’t know where this “stick up for him” comment fits the situation. Sometimes I just feel like I’m not allowed to have new experiences without him and then he makes me feel guilty. 

AITA?


EDIT- info: my husband and I have been together in total for 5 years. My grandmother passed before we got together. He knows how much she means to me. I honor her every holiday by plating food and lighting a candle next to her picture so I know that she feels loved and cared for in the afterlife. I also love my husband very dearly and I would marry him in every lifetime without question. I appreciate everyone’s perspective and taking time out of their day to write on here even if it’s an opposing view. "
191,1jvlej9,Not the A-hole,AITA for stopping a surprise party planned for me after returning from a long trip.,"I just got back from a pretty stressful work trip spanning over 6 months. I was home and speaking with my father for one day when he excitedly informed me of his plan inviting 30+ people to my relatively small home without my knowledge. When I protested, quite emphatically to be honest, he became very upset with me.

I am a relatively secluded guy in my thirties with a small social circle, and these trips I take are nothing new. My father is getting older and his health is declining, so I understand where he is coming from with wanting to get my people together. The main point of contention is that my father feels I am not appreciative of his efforts on the plan and that folks making plans to travel in to visit will be disappointed. Perhaps he feels that I don't care for my friends and relatives who want to see me as well. Additionally, while I was away my father and a close friend tended to my home in what I suspect was in preparation for this surprise party.

It's not that I don't want to see my friends and family, or that I'm not appreciative of the the work put into not only my home but the planning as well. It is just that the last thing I want after a stressful and hostile work environment away from home is a bunch of people over when I haven't even had time to decompress. Should I let up and allow something I'm so against come to pass? Or am I the asshole?"
192,1jvl170,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my mother in law I don’t care if people don’t come to my wedding,"Hi friends — I’m 25F and marrying my fiancé (29M) this fall. Even though we started wedding planning a bit late, we haven’t had any issues finding vendors.

Today, we toured five venues. The first four weren’t really my style, and honestly, I wasn’t even interested in seeing them. The one I really wanted was last on the list. As soon as I saw it, I knew it was the one.

It’s a beautiful Southern-style venue about 45 minutes outside the city. It took me 38 minutes to get there from the fourth venue, but my MIL got lost and took about 50 minutes. As soon as she arrived, she hated it because it was “too far” and also because the property has a lake view. She immediately said, “What if the kids get out here and drown?”

First of all, that’s why I said no kids.
Second, other people’s children are not my responsibility.

I made it clear that this is the venue I want. It’s perfect, within budget, and exactly what I envisioned. But all she can do is complain — about how far it is, what people are going to say, and what they’re going to do.

To that, I responded: If people don’t care enough about me to drive 45 minutes, then I don’t really care to have them celebrate with me anyway.

We ended up going our separate ways, but it’s super obvious she’s upset — and honestly, it’s really pissing me off.

At the end of the day, this wedding matters most to me and my fiancé — not anyone else. I don’t want to look back and feel like I settled for a venue I didn’t love just to make other people comfortable."
193,1jvkqfm,Not the A-hole,AITA for knocking on the floor when the neighbors are screaming?,"I moved to a new apartment 2 months ago and it's been wonderful except that my downstairs neighbors are so loud that I thought they were my upstairs neighbors for the first month. They have two young children who will scream at the top of their lungs, barely pausing for breath, for HOURS (we're talking 3-4 hours straight). Idk how old they are but they are walking age and are in at least preschool. Then the parents just scream at them as well. They don't actually talk/parent, they just say ""ça va?"" over and over in increasingly angry tones of voice (Quebec). 

What's worse is that this all begins at 5am every morning and lasts all day on weekends. It's been driving me insane but I don't want to noise complain because it's a family and I don't want them to have trouble with the landlord. I also sleep odd hours and I don't speak French well, and I just frankly don't want to talk to them.

So essentially it's gotten to the point that when they have been screaming solid for at least an hour or so, I pointedly stomp on the floor 3 times. If they don't shut up I'll do it once more like 30 mins later. I try not to unless they're being really disruptive and it's an ungodly hour (like when they wake me up over and over), but frankly it's happened at least 3 times in the last week where I couldn't take it. In total, I'd say instances I've stomped have been 10-15 times in 2 months. 

Well idk if this was just an asshole move, sure I could have tried to go and confront them and explain in my bad french at 5am, but I didn't want to. But today I got home and from 5pm-9pm they've been yelling. So, stomp stomp stomp then stop.

2 mins later I hear stomping and my doorbell ring and the mum showed up at my door and looked like she was shaking she was so angry. She said that when I made noise it only makes the problem worse (funny, because they tend to shut up when I do) and that her kids are only 5 so ofc they scream. She was angry that I've been knocking/stomping briefly on the floor and told me to stop it. 

AITAH for making sound i. response to their screaming? I know I could have talked to them directly but I feel like the offense is a bit lopsided for her to be the one shaking with anger. "
194,1jvjq3n,Not the A-hole,AITAH telling her what everyone has been thinking out of rage?,"I (19F) started studying to be a teaching assistant three years ago. That’s where I met my amazing friend group, and my friend who this is about (25F).

She joined our group during the first year, around the anniversary of her father’s death. Early on, we noticed she was often late or didn’t show up without warning. When we asked what was going on, she told us she was struggling with the loss of her father. We understood and wanted to support her.

In our second year, we started internships. I happened to be placed at the same school as her. At first, it was fun, but after two weeks, she started skipping without saying anything to the school, mentor, or me. She still went to classes on other days though, which confused me. Eventually, she stopped going to both school and internship altogether.

We checked in again, and she repeated the same thing, life was hard, grief was overwhelming. We felt bad and tried to support her more. One of our guy friends and I even picked her up for school to help her show up. But soon, she’d decide last-minute not to go, or worse, not come outside at all. When we hung out, she’d be hours late and still blamed her dad’s passing.

She ended up losing her internship and got an ultimatum from school. She returned for two weeks and then ghosted again, with no communication, no explanation, just “it’s my dad” again.

Our mentor kept giving her chances. That’s why she’s even still in our program, which most of us find unfair. By the final year, the group had started to distance themselves, she never showed up, never texted. But recently, she’s been around a bit more (if she’s “in the mood”). She noticed we’ve gotten closer to others and told me we’re ignoring her. I told her honestly, a lot has changed over time.

Then a month ago, my grandpa passed away. A few days later she texted me about missing school and I told her why I was out, and she didn’t understand why I was gone for a week. I brushed it off.

A month later, she texts again saying she feels ignored and unloved. I explained why things had shifted, and she replied, “You can’t possibly understand what it’s like to lose someone that close.” That crushed me.

So yeah, I snapped. I finally told her what I (and others) had been holding in:

“You don’t get to use grief as a permanent excuse to disappear on people who actually show up for you. We’ve all got pain,  it’s what you do with it that counts. Stop hiding behind your loss and start showing up, or stop pretending you care.”
This is just a small part of what I send to her  

She called me insensitive and mean. But after she dismissed my grief like it was nothing, I feel like I had every right to say it.

Now I’m just wondering… was I too mean? I honestly don’t know anymore."
195,1jvjiti,Not the A-hole,AITA for avoiding my partner,"My partner and I have been dating 8 months. Around month 2, I brought up how I wanted to go to Coachella. He told me “I’m going with a group of friends”. I assumed it was too planned to get an invite, which was fine. But then like three weeks ago, we were discussing it and I jokingly (maybe a Freudian slip) was like “damn I still didn’t get the Coachella invite” and he was like “babe, I’m going with friends. Some trips are with you and some aren’t. TBH, I’d never want to do Coachella with you”. I laughed it off but it’s been on my mind since he said it. Yesterday, he asked me to help him prepare for the Coachella trip (taking him to the store, picking up some of the people in the group) and nonstop wouldn’t stop talking about how excited they were. That kinda of pmo. Am I the asshole for avoiding my partner til he comes back? I don’t wanna fight or argue with him, I just don’t want to hear about it. “Outta sight outta mind” type deal. "
196,1jvjgij,Asshole,AITA for not buying my step-dad a new phone?,"Recently, my step-dad broke his phone. I don't know why but he comes to my house unannounced and asks me to buy him a new phone. I was so blindsided and confused because he is a doctor, so I know he is hella rich. I laugh it off thinking he's joking but then he asks why im laughing. So now im like wtf? Of course, I tell him no and he loses it.

He starts yelling, threatening to tell my mom. Mind you, it was like 10pm so my daughter comes down and asks whats happening. So now im fucking pissed because he fucking woke up my 8 year old daughter. I tell him to get the fuck out and not come back.

If it helps, my mom is on my side. Opinions?

  
edit - i do have the money to buy the phone but i do not feel like its my responsibility to buy him one"
197,1jvjdip,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to be my sister’s bridesmaid because she chose “ugly friends” to make herself look better?,"My sister (27F) is getting married and asked me (24F) to be one of her bridesmaids. I was excited — until I found out who the rest of the bridal party was. Every single one of them is someone she’s either not that close to, or has made fun of before for being “awkward” or “not photogenic.” Some of her actual best friends — the ones who she sees all the time — weren’t even asked.

It felt weird, so I asked her why she picked this group. She kind of laughed and said, “You’ll understand when it’s your wedding. You don’t want people who’ll outshine you in your own pictures.”

I just stared at her. I asked, “So you picked them because you think they’ll make you look better?” She rolled her eyes and said, “It’s not that deep. I just want to feel confident that day, and I’m allowed to be a little selfish for my wedding.”

That rubbed me the wrong way. I told her I didn’t want to be part of a bridal party built on tearing other people down — even subtly — and that she should’ve picked people she actually cares about.

Now she’s calling me judgmental and sensitive, and our mom says I’m being “too idealistic” and should just support her. But I feel like going along with it makes me complicit.

AITA?"
198,1jviso9,Asshole,"AITA for messaging my Aunt in a group chat, and calling her out?","In Feb of this year, my grandmother passed away. After years of the family scrambling together to make sure my grandma received the best care available, we were all exhausted and not doing great mentally.

My mum decided that she would treat myself, and my 2 Aunts (I'll call them June and Sarah here) to a 4 night holiday for around May this year.

We were all added to a group chat, and after trying to configure dates, we realised that Sarah wouldn't be able to get time off work when the rest of us were free. Sarah said to look at holidays for just the 3 of us (me, mum, June). We agreed on a holiday in Turkey, and as mum had set a budget of £1500, we went for a fancier hotel than we normally would- as it was just 3 of us now.

Jump to last night- my Aunt Sarah messaged the group chat, and asked when our trip was booked for, and what hotel we were staying in. I sent her the information. Sarah then asked if it would be possible to include her, and amend the booking (now 3 weeks away). My mum looked into how to add Sarah to the booking, and also asked who was paying for Sarah's holiday, as she had spend her budget already. Sarah replied ""oh"".

My Aunt June said that she would be willing to pay half of her holiday, if Sarah paid the other half.

Sarah then messages my mum, separately, saying:
""Know it sounds
cheeky but will you
be able to put
anything towards the
trip""

To which my mum replied:
""1 already have £1600!
If we were all going
we would have been
staying somewhere
cheaper. My budget
was £1500. To be
honest I was more
bothered about [June]
and [OP] going away
as their partners
don't have passports
You have plenty of
holidays with [Sarah's husband]
and more spare
money than they do.
You are putting me
in a horrible position
when I was just
trying to be nice. xox""

According to mum, Sarah apologised, but I was still really angry about the situation. 

In the holiday group chat, I sent this message:
""I think it's too much of a faff so close to the time going. Plus sounds like you don't have the money for it. Maybe go on holiday with [Sarah's husband]? 

Mums too nice to say it, but I'm not. The absolute CHEEK to turn down the holiday at the booking time, and then try to jump in WITHOUT INTENDING TO PAYING FULL, is ludicrous! 🤷‍♀️""

A couple of hours later, Sarah replied:
""Well I was booking it myself but that seals the deal. Remember at the time mums death, works reluctance to let me go and then the availability becoming free as someone eventually would change came so sudden.
Your mum actually has spoken to me and no badness was ever intended I was actually elated that i had was  the opportunity to join the family, with your vile imput that has put a stop to that.""

I simply replied:
""You get back from the world what you put into it 😘✌️""

June is trying to get us to make up and all go on the trip together and Mum is MIA from the group chat 👀

TLDR: AITA for calling out my Aunt in a group chat, who was expecting a free holiday?"
199,1jvi2q6,Asshole,AITA for acting casual when inviting guests to my home for the first time?,"3 days ago, my bf, and I invited his friend and the friend’s gf to paint eggs (on short notice) at our apt after we already started. The gf invited us to an art session the next day hosted by her. We weren’t sure we’d make it; hence, this gathering was an alternative. 4 of us had hung out previously 4 times before; no issues raised. My bf knows his friend from school.

When guests arrived, I quickly explained the process. The gf asked if there’s a video, to which I said, “Probably.” Guests had some questions throughout the activity. I took some time to answer them, and my answers were brief/jokey. Once, I raised my voice and said, “What are you doing?” when the gf used the tool with hot wax incorrectly, but overall, I felt good and calm.

After colouring, we played a board game. I got in my usual competitive mood and poked everyone when I noticed some mistakes. Eventually, I said something like, “I’ve been bullying you all for the whole night,” gf asked why, I said, “Cause I’m a shitty person, obviously,” not realizing she’s 100% serious. Later, my bf and I thought of a way to cheat, whispered about it, giggled; when confronted, I said it’s just a joke.

After guests left, I messaged gf thanking her for coming over. She messaged she didn’t enjoy pointless friction and powerplay from me, that we’re not compatible to hang out, and that she uninvited me to her art session. She unfollowed me and removed me from her followers. I didn’t fully understand what she meant, so we messaged a bit. She told me to google a phrase that meant “a guest is akin to God.” She also said I -was unnecessarily rude, unfriendly, a failed host; -didn’t answer questions, consider how she felt, read the room; -laughed too loud in front of the guests; -made my bf uncomfortable (he said it was weird she thought so). She explained how my bf tried to make the experience better and asked me not to invite people over when I’m moody (I wasn’t).

I also messaged bf’s friend and apologized if he felt uncomfortable. He was ok, said he hoped we’d have more chances to do things together.

Gf messaged my bf and told him he was still invited to her art session (he didn’t go). She sent him a funny reel afterwards. She also made a reel with some videos of the eggs she took, thanked me and him, but tagged only him.

Background on online interactions: at our previous gathering, my bf asked her in a friendly way to send me some reels as well (she was constantly messaging him, and he told me he thought it was weird). We also had a group chat, but regardless, she messaged us separately when she invited us both to something. We asked her to use the group chat, but she continued to send separate messages.

Overall, I didn’t see our gathering as an “official event.” or myself as a facilitator. I do mentor students and young adults sometimes, so I know how to be courteous, but with friends, I prefer to be more casual.

Clearly, I misread our level of friendship, but at the end of the day, AITA and a shitty host?"
200,1jvhicy,Asshole,AITA for complaining about my unreliable friend's mom?,"(15M) Every day I get a ride home from my high school from my ""friend's"" mom, because my own mom has work. (Technically my grandma can drive me everyday, but I don't want to ask that of her) She is usually there on time, but she has forgotten to come a once or twice, and my friend has to call her.  This makes me about ten minutes late getting home. I have a new puppy who shits a lot so I need to be home asap everyday. Today, she forgot again, and I told my friend that his mom is unreliable and has a bad track record of picking us up. He snapped and told me I was ungrateful and I can get my own ride if I'm gonna complain. Why can't he see the situation from my perspective? AITA?"
201,1jvh34i,Asshole,AITA for going to Coachella instead of staying home the day of my brother’s passing.,My brother is an Army vet who just passed away this morning. My mom and dad is grieving but my mom is taking the news harder than anybody. I am her only son left. I don't want to leave her but I am supposed to leave later today to go to southern california for Coachella. My trip to coachella has been planned for a long time now and I have spent a lot of money for this trip. Am I the asshole for deciding to go to Coachella instead of being home with family?
202,1jvgx1h,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my mates for fuel money after a planned beach trip i drove them too?,"Hi all, I recently took a few of my mates on a planned day out to Bournemouth beach. I ended up being one of the drivers, and I drove a total of 120 miles (60 miles each way) in my own car, with my mates as passengers.

After the trip, I asked them if they could chip in for petrol, and they seemed really surprised. One of them said something like, “I didn’t think you’d ask for petrol money,” and it kind of caught me off guard because I didn’t say anything beforehand. I assumed they’d clock that a long drive like that might need a bit of help with fuel costs.

For context, I wasn’t trying to make money off it, i was just looking to cover the petrol since it was a full day out and I was driving the whole way. Now I’m feeling unsure. I don’t want to seem stingy, but petrol’s not cheap and it was a decent distance."
203,1jvgfw5,Not the A-hole,WIBTA saying he has to work alone?,"I'm on mobile so I hope the formatting is okay, sorry. 

I'm (32F) working on a project with a friend (30M). It involves some skills that we each have exclusively, as well as some that we share. I did the preparatory research. He can code. We both 3D model. We are contractually obligated to finish a project together. 

He said that he wants me to be in charge of all the writing, that he doesn't know how to get printing done, and I keep getting all the emails and acting as an unofficial secretary/calendar for both of us (he'd forgotten another deadline earlier). This project is based on my research he hasn't read, so I will also have to either make an infographic or explain it to him enough that he can make it. We had originally agreed to split the 3D modelling evenly. Last week he told me that he had a job interview for which he'd promised something he hadn't made yet, and that he'd be unavailable for a week.

We were due to submit our project for evaluation at the beginning of April. I guess he forgot. He hasn't read my text reminding him that our employer has requested a check-in. 

Now I'm making a lot of the 3D models myself, on top of doing all the textures and most of the color design. I'm trying to make things for him to be able to simply code in and add quickly. He's postponed working together three times, including this one-week no-contact break, so I feel like I just have to do this alone or it won't get done. 

He's just not available. The employer trusted me when I said I trust him. My reputation is on the line. I feel like I'm paying the price for him needing to make something he'd lied and said was already made, for another potential employer. 

I know I have anxiety and can overreact. But we're getting email inquiries about our progress? And I work independently, while he waits for us to meet to work on it. He has every right to edit what I've made, but it does feel like he waits for me to do something and then he spends time re-doing it, instead of talking beforehand and planning/contributing/editing together. 

But. He does have the right to edit my stuff and put his spin on it. Job interviews are important, and faking it seems normal. So WIBTA if I told him that he has to take sole responsibility for some models, and that I won't be available to help with them? Moreover..wibta if I told him that his decisions have made me physically ill from stress and extra-long days? Is that unnecessarily dramatic, when we should focus on finishing the project? Should I just stick to necessary info? Should I do whatever I can, and then tell him later that it's been unfair?

(Fwiw, while I deeply respect that he codes, it's a language he doesn't know well and I've also had to help troubleshoot that. I've watched the entire process. He isn't working extra time invisibly.)

This all started when I shared my research after he expressed interest in doing something together. We were dear friends for about 4 years prior to this experience. 

Edit: He forgot that we'd promised certain things on a certain timeline. He had his own timeline that he never shared with me. He didn't read the email I'd forwarded. Before he understood that he was not on the employer's timeline, he told me that my list of questions/task inquiries (""this crap"") was overwhelming and a clear sign of my mental instability and need to be in control. Amid other parental, patronizing comments. "
204,1jvg6jo,Not the A-hole,"WIBTAH If I leave my sick mother to deal with my declining grandmother, to go on a trip with friends?","I (19M) & 3 buddies planned to visit Indiana from PA to see 7 friends who we have known for 5 years. I've already put in $300 for it and we have everything ready. However, this week my Mom (44) and Grandma (73) *who is very dependent on my mom*, started having Very High blood pressure. And my mom has Intense Chest pains. Both went to the doctors, My grandma was given more blood pressure meds and my mom found she has Very bad Anxiety. My mom had Stage 4 Cancer when I was 6 but has been in remission for 13 years. She is scared cancer can come back if her anxiety and BP don't come down in a few months. She is asking for more help, so I said it would stay back if she wasn't ok before she got checked by doctors. She is okay now and was just told to relax More and take it easy. After finding she is okay, I decided im gonna go. Now she is very upset that I still want to go on the trip when she needs more help and because she's scared of my illness.

I have “Sickle cell: Beta Thalassemia”, which is genetic. My mom has always been extremely over protective, controlling and shelters me in fear of “Flair ups.” My illness has a chance to be fatal but is usually benign. Most of my time is spent inside, online or at work 5 days a week. I'm VERY limited on things I can do. Theres No swimming, No cold temps, Hot temps, contact sports, or “wild” physical activities for me. Everything I do can put me into a “Sickle Cell Crisis/fair up” so I do everything with caution. 

Since 15 I've hated being stuck in the house feeling like its all I can do. I did my own research, talked With my doctors and found I can do a lot if I am careful. I want to travel, explore and live my own life without “Mommy holding my hand” and feeling like I need her 24/7. This is not the first trip I've taken out of State without her. I've been to Upstate New York and Atlantic City and WildWood which are all 3 hours away. I get this is the furthest I've been and the Situation with my grandma and mom are a bit sketchy. But I feel like they’d be fine without me for a week.

I have 3 sisters, 34, 26 and 14 who are around. The oldest have 3 kids each, so I suggested my younger sister who lives with us can help her out. The others can help when they have time. My mom is very scared of me being 8-9 hours away without her and she has been drilling me and saying ""I do nothing for her"" and “She does everything for us but we don't do anything for her and she gets no help around the house or in general” after I said I want to still go. I feel shes guilt tripping and bestowing fear in me. I am a bit nervous for the trip since It's 9hrs away but I have taken all the necessary precautions for if i do have a Flair Up down there and am very good with handling things without the need for doctors. I have all basis Covered but part of me still feels like I shouldn't go and I'm doing something wrong…

205,1jvflvn,Not the A-hole,AITA for not inviting my stepmom to my graduation?,"So I, 18F, am graduating high school this May. For context, I've known her, 47F, since I was 3 but never got close to her. There's been several events that I've encountered with her that makes me not want her to celebrate this achievement with me. Recently I found out how many graduation tickets I'm getting, and I didn't invite my stepmom. My dad, 47M, found out about this arrangement and got mad about it. He practically yelled at me saying she is the mother that raised me, and she deserves a place at my graduation just as much as he does. He told me if she doesn't get a ticket she can't go. I'm torn because I want my dad there with me, but i don't want her there to celebrate with me. so, AITA

If you guys want, I can give y'all a list of things that's happened."
206,1jvfln7,Everyone Sucks,AITA for getting frustrated that my girlfriend always falls asleep on the couch?,"We’ve been dating for over 2.5 years. She always falls asleep when we watch TV or relax on the couch. Initially, this was adorable as someone was willing to trust me enough to consistently fall asleep on me. I was patient and gently woke her up and put her to bed. After a year, I became impatient because I knew her well enough to be able to tell she was getting comfortable and about to sleep. So, I pause what we’re watching and ask if she wants to go to bed. She always says she wants to stay on my lap. At first, I found this heartwarming and finished the remaining chores in the house, even though I didn’t appreciate she didn’t want to do it before falling asleep. And when i woke her back up to move to the bedroom she always wakes up confused and agitated. This makes me uncomfortable, and I’ve never liked waking anyone up. I also started feeling a bit parental which is not the kind of relationship i want to have. 

Last night she was falling asleep on the couch again and i needed to go shower. I asked her if she wants to stay up or go to bed because I am going to shower. She said she will stay up until i am back. When i returned from the shower i found her sleeping and all of her homework left out on the table (she needs to pack up so she can leave to work tomorrow). We had a major fight because i woke her up but in an openly annoyed and agitated way and told her to start “acting like an adult and sleep on the bed”. We havent spoken since and she is very mad at me. I am not sure how to handle this situation and wondering if i have to comfort her to bed for the rest of my life. "
207,1jvf3ze,Asshole,WIBTA if I wore red to my girlfriend’s cousin wedding after being told I can’t ?,"I f(21) will be attending my girlfriend’s(21) cousin wedding. They are super close because their moms are identical twins and view each other as sisters. Anyway I’ve met the cousin (May)  a bunch of times and she’s super sweet and kind. Today my girlfriend was asking me what color my dress was. She has seen the dress plenty of times because I’ve shown her many times. Then my girlfriend goes on to say that I can’t wear the dress because red means I’m trying to seduce the husband ? I’ve never heard that rule before. I know not to wear white and that’s about it.  She said it’s not her family but the grooms family are pretty strict about it. I asked her to ask may to see what she thinks about it. My girlfriend said it might be awhile to hear from her. I don’t have the time or money to find a new dress(broke college student) it’s not even a sexy red dress either. The wedding is this Saturday and I have no other options. I’d received the wedding invitation a year ago and it said nothing about not wearing red. I’ve even check their wedding website and all it said for dress attire was white was not allowed and you will be escorted out. I told my sister and she said I would be an asshole if I go through with it but I’m not sure.So would I be the asshole if I show up in a red dress?
Edit I posted the dress on my account. I recently wore it to my uncles wedding 
Edit: I’m waiting for what the bride says because my girlfriend’s mom is the one who told her this rule 


EDIT:I CAN WEAR THE DRESS. The bride got back to me saying she’s never said red wasn’t allowed. "
208,1jvez84,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to go to a online stranger’s home?,"A lot of context is needed for this so please bear with me for a moment.
So this happened on an app called Grokio, some weird dating, networking, social app aimed mostly at furries? 
Another thing, I suffer with extreme paranoia, and got some personal issues with trust. Its not like, oh I hear voices and see things, I just have an itch when I’m out in public by myself, like there’s someone trying to get or follow me.
I (23M) was contacted by 36F when I made a pretty dumb rant post about buying the wrong pc part. Yes I’m an idiot but thats beside the point.

So what happens is this, she asks me what specs my computer is running, I don’t know much and just tell her my GPU, I’m not very smart with tech anyhow. She then asks, “Do you get many beautiful girls in your dms talking about computers?” Now in her defense I saw this as flirting, and she said it wasn’t. So, my mistake, whatever.
But what she then asked was if I wanted to go to her home with my PC and build together. I told her no I don’t feel comfortable. She proceeds to ask if it would be better if she drove over to my house, or even come pick me up. I tell her that I am absolutely not comfortable with that. I have paranoia, and a lot of trust issues, especially if it’s someone who I just met online.
She keeps trying to convince me that she wasn’t dangerous, and that she has friends who can vouch for her. Then proceeds to tell me I’m not paranoid, but I just have social anxiety. I do my best to tell her that I really do suffer with this, but keeps saying that its wrong and its just social anxiety.
But I guess, the TLDR is this, am I the asshole for refusing to go to an online stranger’s house?
(Oh yeah! Not that I seen it but for future proofing, the reason why I let the chat with her go on for so long was because I am a people pleaser. I hate leaving off on a bad note, but when she started to attack my mental health issues I had to leave the chat.)"
209,1jveyhl,Asshole,AITA for poking fun at my friend at his birthday party?,"
I (24m) have been best friends with ""Matt"" and ""Jack"" since I was 16.  After college we started living together in an apartment. 

After living together we found out that Matt had this funny habit of never wearing clothes at home. Literally ever. He's only in his tighty whities, think Walter White. He's mentioned doing this when we were younger but we never got to see it in all its glory until we got a place. We've poked fun at him but never had an issue with it because he's like our weird brother. 

Anyway a few of us in the friend group decided to have a party for Max last weekend since it was his birthday. One of our other friends ""Jenna"" had an idea the theme could be everyone dress like Max. Max has a distinctive style of dress (think like 90s grunge would be the best to describe it but not too versed in fashion so idk-think like open flannels with band Ts underneath).  Everyone loved the idea and it was going to be a surprise. 

Anyway Jack and I had the good idea as a gag to make our entrance to the party in tighty whities and an undershirt like Max always wears at home like a gag. And we did that. We didn't stay in em all night just came down, got laughs from everyone, and then left. 

However turns out Max was kinda pissed. None of our other friends knew he did that at home and he was embarrassed by people asking him questions and having to explain. I don't think it was a big deal; it's not like we showed pictures. If anything Jack and I made fools of ourselves. We never even told people that that was the specific undies he wore so they might've thought we were just doing that for comedic effect. 

Anyway max was being distant this week and told us it hurt his feelings to put him on blast. Jack essentially told him to get over it but I've been neutral until I can figure out if I've done"
210,1jvehd1,Not the A-hole,AITA for saying my aunt doesn’t deserve a pet?,"My aunt (27 f) has a 5 year old yorkie. When she moved in with me (17 f) and my mother, she brought her son and her yorkie along with her. She said in light hearted banter that since she had her son she hasn’t really been giving her dog (scruffy) much attention. So naturally, being a loner, and sort of keeping to myself, I had a lot of time and attention to give to Scruffy. We bonded, she felt like my own dog. I feed her, i walk her, i make sure she’s groomed. 

Today I come home from school and she didn’t run to me like usual, so I look around for about five minutes and start to get anxious since she’s not coming to my calls. My mother, aunt and cousin come home from somewhere, and I ask if they’ve seen her since this morning, and they said she ran out of the house when they left. I asked why nobody went after her, and they said they called her but she continued to run away. And then my aunt proceeded to say that if she comes back she comes back, if she doesn’t oh well. 

I said if that’s her opinion on something she’s meant to care for, then she doesn’t deserve a pet. And she shouldn’t have ever got her if she cares that little. Now they’re making me out to be disrespectful.

AITA? 

Edit: Out of slight fear family will see this. I will be blurring out the dog’s name.

Other things to mention: Scruffy has no collar. She has a blue collar that is ten times too big for her, with no tag. She can easily slip her collar (as she’s done plenty of times lol) So if someone finds her they have no way of knowing where she came from. That’s where a lot of my anxiety comes from. She knows her way home since she’s run out before, but this is the longest she’s been out. I’m worried sick. We live in a nice neighborhood, but Scruffy is an obviously expensive and well taken care of dog. She’s also very friendly. I don’t doubt someone would take her in, assuming she was a stray or maybe abandoned. I will update if she comes home, but I’m honestly so shaken with anger and anxiety I don’t have much energy to add anything else. 

Update: I appreciate all the kind words (and not so kind words regarding my aunt lol). Scruffy is back. It felt like I could finally breathe hearing her claws on the hardwood floors. Thank you all for your support and allowing me to vent, and also confirming that i’m not crazy. haha."
211,1jvedqk,Not the A-hole,AITA for not snapping at someone?,"This started with a conversation I had with my cousin. We’re both in IT—he's M(30), I’m M(20). He recommended I get an ASUS TUF laptop last year for school and work. I bought it, but last week the hinge broke. I asked if he knew anything about that issue—he didn’t. I joked that the damage could’ve been avoided if the base was sturdier, maybe made out of carbon fibre. I said at that price I’d rather get a whole new PC with an RTX 5090 (I currently have a 3070). He said I should’ve done that. I joked, “If only I had $60k to spend on a laptop 🤣” (equivalent to $3;000 locally). Then he said I already had three computers, including a MacBook. That confused me—I only own this laptop. I bought a desktop in 2021, which my girlfriend now uses. I said, “I don’t have a MacBook? I only have the laptop,” and he replied, “That is very much your choice.” When I asked what he meant, he said, “I suggested getting a good gaming laptop but you got a desktop and then bought a laptop. You're good at wasting money.” His tone felt rude and condescending. For context, I bought the desktop during COVID because school had moved online. He advised me to wait, but I didn’t, and he keeps bringing it up. Instead of snapping, I responded calmly: “I understand you have your opinions, but I don’t appreciate being criticized for my personal choices. I spent my money in a way that works for me. I bought the desktop because it suited my needs, and now I need this laptop for portability and work. If I kept reminding you for four years about a purchase you made that I thought was a bad idea, I’m sure it would get on your nerves. And if I told you that you're good at wasting money, I don’t think you’d appreciate it either. The computer I own—just this laptop—works perfectly fine for me, and honestly, it shouldn’t be your concern.” A few minutes later he sent a voice note sounding angry: “Bro I literally don't F\*\*\*ing care, I am sick and tired of your bulls\*\*t attitude, thinking you’re better than me. Do whatever makes you happy, but the fact of the matter is I am right. And I actually know some shit that you don't know. And one day you're gonna realise that.” I didn’t respond. I talked to a few friends who agreed he was being unreasonable and might be projecting. For extra context, he recently got a large inheritance and has been spending about $5;000 a month since early 2024. That’s his business, but it’s ironic considering how judgmental he was about my spending. Now I’m left wondering—did I say something wrong, or did I do the right thing by staying calm? Should I have stood up for myself more directly?"
212,1jvdtf8,Asshole,AITA for expecting my wife to keep the same responsibilities after a career change?,"Made a throwaway so I 35m could post this. My wife f40 recently changed careers and has started a new job. I have been supportive through her entire career change and tried to help her in any way possible along the way. However, things have changed since she started the job. She's much more exhausted when she comes home from work compared to before, and instead of dealing with this and managing change, she expects me to cater to her schedule when I have my own work schedule to still manage. 

Her old work schedule was 8am-3pm. Because she started work around the same time our kids (10m and 7m) had to be at school, she would wake them up and get them ready in the morning and make sure they got to school. I didn't do this because I wake up between 9am and 10am every day and she was waking up around the time they needed to so it made more sense (I work 11am-7pm). Her new job is working 10pm-6am (same amount of work hours per day as me). Our kids need to wake up at 6:30am to make it to school on time. I figured she would start getting them ready after coming back from work and go to sleep afterward since she had this responsibility before, plus it would only be an extra hour of staying awake maximum.

When we discussed how our new schedules would be with her new work hours, she was expecting me to start waking up early to get the kids ready instead of her. I am not a morning person and she functions much better early than I do. I said this expectation is unfair to me because I still have my own work schedule to manage and it shouldn't be on me to change that for a career move she decided to make under no pressure from me. She thinks I am being inconsiderate and expecting too much from her. It's been tense between us ever since we argued about this and it feels like an elephant in the room. AITA?"
213,1jvdsun,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling me friends to delete their reviews of my cafe?,"I opened a cafe a few months ago. The premise is very small and my business partner and I live directly above it so it's closer to a side hustle more than anything since we only open for the morning rush. Business has been steadily increasing and we've been getting nothing but good feedback from our customers so far. 

Last month I invited my entire friend group to enjoy a beverage and slice of cake at the cafe for free in exchange for honest feedback in the form of a Google review since I wanted to try out some new drink ideas and also get a little bit more traffic on our Google page. My friends ate, drank then bounced and good time was had by all. Each of them promised to write a review the next day. 

Every single friend wrote a review. And every single one was obviously generated by chatgpt and written in American English (not even the official language here). Some of the reviews even mentioned services or drink items that we don't have! I was really conflicted. While I appreciate them taking (a moment of) their time to write a review I feel like not only was it a half assed gesture but also I think that since people can tell a fake review from a genuine one it affects my cafe's credibility. Would you visit a cafe where the only reviews are all clearly ai generated? I wouldn't, which is why I've asked a couple of them to take their reviews down and redo it. 

I'm not entirely surprised that they were taken aback and not happy with my request, its not pleasant to be told that your gesture no matter how small is meaningless. One of them even said that they don't feel welcome at my business anymore. But I feel like as a business owner I should be mindful of credibility to the point where I have to risk offending people, unsurprisingly my business partner agrees. 

TDLR: My friends reviewed my cafe using chatgpt and now they're upset that I wasn't grateful"
214,1jvda0m,Not the A-hole,AITA (26F)for telling my nephew (14M) that he is adopted?,"Context - my brother “Billy” 41M and his wife “Chloe” 39F adopted their son “Ryan”14M when he was a newborn. I am 26F and using a throwaway. When my brother and SIL adopted Ryan they decided not to tell him that he was adopted until he was old enough to understand. It’s important to understand that Ryan is a really smart kid, he’s crazy smart. 

Last Friday, we all went round to my parent’s house for dinner. This included, myself, Billy, Chloe, Ryan, my older sister “Ella” 32F and our parents. After dinner, we all kind of separated into different rooms to chill. My nephew and I are both in to Minecraft and he was showing me his new world on his iPad. We were just chatting about the normal stuff when he asked “so why do you think my parents adopted me?” very, very casually. I was caught very off guard because my brother and SIL hadn’t mentioned anything about telling him. I didn’t know what the heck to say and how they’d explained it to him so all I said was “This is something I’d speak to your parents about mate” verbatim. He nodded and said “yeah” and changed the subject. 

Not long after, my brother and Chloe came in and said they were heading home. I didn’t want to mention it infront of Ryan so I thought I’d shoot them a message once they’re home. When they left, I mentioned it to my parents and Ella who were also shocked that Chloe and Billy hadn’t mentioned telling him to them either so none of us were prepared to answer any questions he may have. I messaged Billy and in under 1 minute Chloe was on the phone swearing and screeching like a banshee. It turns out that Ryan had NOT been told that he was adopted and by saying “You should speak to your parents about this” I actually did tell him and I should have said that he’s NOT adopted. I’m not sure why Ryan asked but he’s a smart kid, he must have had some kind of inkling which is why instead of asking directly, he asked my opinion on why. 

That was Friday evening, Chloe went insane down the phone, I could hear Billy in the back ground saying that I was out of line and I’m not a parent so I don’t understand the gravity of what I’ve done etc. It’s now Wednesday evening and my family is still divided and not communicating properly. My parents understand my point of view but our sister, Ella, is saying that I’m an idiot that was “manipulated by a teenager” and has called me a complete asshole for stepping on his parent’s toes. I’ve had Chloe’s family message me over the weekend calling all sorts of names. I’ve been told I’m not allowed to their anniversary party next month etc. 

All this to say, it’s a complete and utter shit show. AITA in this scenario?? I understand that I should have talked to his parents before i gave him any kind of answer but it was in the moment. Does anyone have any advice on what to do now because right now it looks like they’re going no contact with me."
215,1jvc9b1,Not the A-hole,AITA for this messy living situation?,"So to sum up the situation before it got really bad. 

I invited a friend of mine, we can call her Kate for this story, to lived with me (dec 2023) because I had just gone through a bad breakup and my ex was supposed to live with me so to avoid being alone I asked her to move in. The first year wasn’t terrible, kate held a job and more or less kept up with her part of the bills which is 50/50. Kate has no car, no license and no motivation to help herself. So yes I drive her absolutely everywhere.

Thought out the first year (Dec 2023-Dec 2024)
I had brought up multiple times that I was tired of being the one to always clean and keep the house in order. And that I also felt as if I was a mother to both of us.  I expressed that I’m tired of caring for my mental health and hers.

October 2024, I start dating my current boyfriend (c) and within a few months he moves in(YAY but don’t worry we’ve known each other for a few years

Fast forward to Jan 2025. Kate gets fired from no call no showing to work, I’m still taking care of the house and her. Im cleaning, cooking and signing her up for health insurance to try and help her with her depression, I’ve signed kate up for food stamps, I’ve signed her up for dentals and vision insurance. Just to give her the opportunity to help herself, but she just doesn’t want to dude.

Fast forward to now. (May-April 2025)

I got kate a new job at a fast food place( it’s basically all she knows) and she quits within two weeks and lies to me about it. Just stops showing up. Not to mention she’s been jobless since January’s and C and I have been paying all of the bills, food, housing needs etc without ANY help from her. We ask her to keep the house cleaned up at least if she isn’t gonna find a job, she doesn’t feel like it. So she sits around the house for 3 1/2 month without paying or helping in any form. She did receive two paychecks from the fast food joint but I have yet to see any of the $2K+ she owes me.

(Today)
finally got her a job at an of smoke shop I used to work at, this was 3 days ago. Shes been showing up to work but I mean it’s the first week. C and I sat her down last week and tried talking to her telling her we cant physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially take care of her anymore because were struggling and she doesn’t seem to care.

She has no friends no family and no money, if I kick her out she will surely be homeless and shes a friend but I dot know how to stress to her that this situation will not just go away if you ignore it.

I feel like an asshle but my bf C says im not. Im so lost. Please help. 

PS. We rent from my grandparents so theres no lease, how do I even go about any of this????"
216,1jvc8wk,Not the A-hole,AITA for not allowing my aunt to meet my son?,"I (45m) got married late in life and my wife and I had our first child (1m).  We live in a separate state from the rest of my family and visit maybe once a year.

Growing up, my father’s sister (69f) made my life a living hell for some reason.  She would be in my much older brother’s ear about how my parents preferred me over him.  She would tell my parents that I would end up just like her juvenile delinquent daughter.  Now that I’m an adult, she now will point out if I’ve gained weight, remind me of any mistakes I’ve made in life and generally just be nasty and shit talk me to everyone.

I had finally had enough during a random encounter with her while I was with a coworker.  My coworker was singing my praises for helping her with the transition into her new role and that I was a good friend.  My aunt said that couldn’t possibly be true and that I’m bad at my job and a bad person in general.  My coworker was appalled and asked if my aunt really was related to me.

Once my son was born, I put my foot down and said I would not allow this toxic relationship anywhere near my boy as I want to protect him from her bull shit.  We all recently met up in my home state for a wedding and when she bee-lined to me and my son, I abruptly ignored her and went to a different part of the venue.

My family generally understands my feelings towards her but thought I should have taken it easy since it was a joyous family event.  My wife is firmly on my side.  I want my son to have family, especially since he’s the youngest by far, but I don’t think being family is a pass to be a prick to someone.  AITA?

EDIT: A few folks have asked how I could have run into my aunt while with my coworker if I live in a different state.  I was living in the same state when that happened.  I have since moved several states away.

UPDATE:  Thank you to everyone that commented and helped me feel like I’m doing the right thing.  My family gaslights a lot and I was genuinely afraid that I was overreacting as I can be a very passionate person.  I’ve spoken to my father and another aunt who hold a lot of sway in the family and they have agreed to keep my toxic aunt away from me and my son.  They also understand if I remove myself if she inserts herself into a situation where I’m around.

I appreciate this community very much.  Thanks again. "
217,1jvc6mj,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my brother no that he couldn’t send his gf to my house when they fight??,I swear it’s like every other week that they’re fighting and she’s about to pack up and leave and he sends her to my house to fix their issue. Now there I am in the middle of it and I don’t even know WTH is going on but I’m supposed to make her feel better and also at the same time talk my brother up to make him credible for her to give him another chance. And I’m sick of it. Last night I had a million and one things going on and I told him No. I told him to seek professional help that I’m out of it and now I’m the bad guy and getting the cold shoulder. SMH. 
218,1jvbm43,Not the A-hole,AITA since my bf got his miter cycle I hate when he has to use my car., Anyway this a rant/vent My boyfriend (M25) got a motorcycle not too long ago nice rebel Honda w.e and he kind bought it without my knowledge but definitely assumed that I would help by letting him use my car.  I’m a (F24) Anyway long story short bike gets here he’s had for a couple weeks and then boom we got a mini storm heavy rains down here in Florida. The guy calls me an hr bf I start work to pick him up I drive in heavy ass rain. He’s safe brought him to our place he picks it up an or two later when it calms down. Today I get woken up from sleep I work 3rd and I’ve voiced that I don’t really like the idea of him using my car it just bothers the fuck outta me when someone else is gonna be using my things. I’m not an only child ik how to share but my things are mine ! Some ppl don’t respect things that aren’t theirs. Anyway he wakes me up “I’m taking your car” and I was like oh is raining ? What happened ? He replied “I can’t just not take your car? I don’t wanna drive the bike today.” I said fine I don’t have money on SunPass take the main roads.. he said fuck it just pay it later… that’s a bill I’m trynna not to worry about tbh bc have already done that twice and it’s gonna be an annoying one but idk why he couldn’t just said “sure”. Anyway point of the story I understand he’s my partner and we live together but theirs things that I just don’t agree with it when it comes to sharing my car bc I didn’t sign up for this crap he just assumed I would be cool bc we’re a “team” dude f**k that. You should’ve spoken to me first now I gotta deal with your bitch ass emotions bc I don’t like you using my car and agin idk why it’s infuriates me when ppl gotta touch my stuff and not take care of it properly. Anyway long story short that’s my rant maybe IATA. But idc the point of this was to feel better and I don’t 😂 he took my car to his job and I’m debating just getting a camera for inside the car that records tbh i know I shouldn’t but it would make me feel way better and protected from the ppl reckless driving 
219,1jvakdy,Not the A-hole,AITA for correcting my own kid while coaching?,"I coach a variety of youth sports, more often than not the parents are much harder to deal with than the kids. I'm currently coaching an 8 and under recreational baseball team. Last night I had a parent question my coaching style and say that her son may not be able to play for me anymore.

My son dropped a ball, ran after it, and overthrew to the 1st baseman. We had already had a team discussion that errors happen but compound errors (more than one in a row) will cost us games. I yelled to my son ""(son's name) you have to make good catches and good throws, these compound errors are going to hurt us"" I didn't scream, there was no anger in my voice, I was trying to make an example of that related to what we had just talked about.

One of the moms watching our practice walked up to the fence and called me over. She asked if I was going ""yell at all the kids like that"". I told her that all of the kids will receive feedback good and bad but I need to get to know them and their abilities better. I explained that was my own son I had just corrected and knowing his abilities I expected better out of him. She said she doesn't think there should be any negativity towards any of the kids and doesn't know if her son will be able to play for someone who yells. 

I really don't feel what I said was out of line for anyone's kid, let alone my own but understand some people are more sensitive than others.  So AITA for correcting my kid while coaching?"
220,1jvafy5,Asshole,AITA for trying to prevent my friend from getting their first choice room because I don’t want to live next to them?,"So for context, I’m in college and about to move into a house with five other people for the next two years. The house has two rooms and a shared bathroom per floor, and the first floor is all common space (kitchen, laundry, living room, no rooms).

All the rooms are different sizes with different closet space. Since I found the house, everyone agreed I’d get first pick, and the rest of the group filled out a form ranking their room preferences.

Here’s where things get messy, three people (including the one this post is about) put the room next to mine as their top choice. They've been basically trying to “claim” the room since we toured, talking about it as if it’s already theirs, even though nothing’s been finalized yet.

I wouldn't mind, but I currently live with them (and one of the other future roommates), and it’s honestly been tough. They’re not a bad person, but they’re extremely inconsiderate. They leave dishes in the sink for days (which irks me because most of the dishes are mine), rarely clean up after themselves (or just in general), have people over late almost every night, and can be pretty loud. I’ve tried bringing it up gently, like asking if we can just rinse dishes or not leave stuff out overnight, but they get defensive or annoyed. I understand I can be too much, however they have made unprovoked petty comments about my cleanliness habits (like asking them to use a coaster, or wash their dishes before going to bed).

On top of all that, I go to bed early and have early classes, while they tend to stay up late. They shower usually at night, and the bathroom wall connects to my room, so I’d hear everything. On top of that, they tend to work at the same time I have class, and having to get ready at the same time as someone else is one of my biggest pet peeves. So the idea of living right next to them for two years sounds like a nightmare.

What makes it worse is I’m worried even if someone else gets that room, they’ll guilt them into switching. One of our current roommates even said if they don’t get the room, they’ll “crash out,” which I lowkey agree with. I actually asked them if they’d be okay with one of their other ranked options (since they only selected the one room), and they said they wouldn’t do well “mentally” if they didn’t get it. I’m not trying to dismiss mental health at all, I just don’t think it’s fair when other girls are also dealing with things and still trying to be fair to each other.

I’m torn between asking one of the other people who want the room not to give it up, or doing a random draw and rigging it. But would that make me the asshole? I really do care about this friend (even though it might not sound like it here), and I’m scared this could mess up our relationship. But I also don’t want to be miserable in my own home.

AITA?"
221,1jv9uz2,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my mom she did a bad job raising my brother,"For context, | (20F) have a 14 year old brother who has absolutely no respect for anyone around him. I am bigger in size and he constantly makes remarks around that, commenting on how empty my social life is, as well as bringing up my own depression and past attempts. I still live with my mom and moving out isn't quite an option yet.

My mom caves into my brother's antics all of the time. He will act out, cry and scream, and then my mom takes him to some kind of event that he enjoys. There is absolutely no follow through when he gets punished whereas when I was his age, if I spoke the way he did I would have lost every single privilege you could think of. I try talking to my brother and figuring out the real root of the problem but he can't have a single conversation with me without taking a jab at my weight and appearance. I also want to note that my father passed away four years ago, my brothers behavior was always nasty but I think it worsened. So anyways, my brother comes home and he's telling me that the dogs got into the trash and I needed to clean it up. I tell him that he should do something around the house for once in his life (he never cleans, he can't wash his own clothes) and so he calls my mom and tells her what I said.
My mom yelled at me saying that I shouldn't be telling my brother what to do. I told her if she hadn't done such a horrible job raising him then this phone call wouldn't have even occurred. This was about a week ago and things are kind of awkward between the two of us. My mom has done absolutely nothing about my brother's behavior for years and I am beyond fed up with how disrespectful and rude he is. I don't expect him to treat me like a professional or someone with higher ranking, I just want him to see me as his sister and not his punching bag.

EDIT: my dad was an absuive alcoholic and NOT a good role model for my brother. i don’t blame him completely and i do not want to talk badly on the deceased, but neither of my parents could “handle” my brother. he’s always been misbehaved. "
222,1jv9jjq,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my 17 year old she needs to go to her volunteer job and not “no call-no show” for a third time,"My daughter is 17. She is good in school and working hard. She has no chores or rules really. The one rule we have is that she leave her location on her phone if she’s going out. In our country, it’s legal for her to drink and so she goes to bars. She doesn’t have a curfew she just has to keep us updated that she’s safe. These rules work for her because she is normally responsible. We let her throw a house party recently where it was supposed to be 25 people and at least 100 kids came. We cleaned up the mess. 

She signed up for a volunteer job to get into college and it’s every Sunday for three hours. She has been doing this since January and already missed two weeks. One due to illness, one due to illness from a hangover. She also has left a half hour early every week since she started. This Sunday she overslept but there was still time to get in and she said she wasn’t going. I told her she has to go. She made a commitment and that if she doesn’t want to do it she should give her two weeks notice. 

She said I’m controlling her. I asked how. She said asking for examples is a form of gaslighting. She called me a c-word multiple times. She can’t give me any other examples of me being controlling but insists I am. She told me she will never let me see my grandchildren when she has them. She said I’ve been yelling at her for six months and been rude. My husband was in disbelief because he’s been here and I haven’t yelled at her at all. She then tried to storm out without her phone and I told her she needed to go to her room and she said that was abuse. 

She can talk very fast and confuses my husband sometimes so now I don’t know if I’m the crazy one. I know maybe we should have more rules, but I had very very controlling abusive parents so I have tried to be much more permissive. 

Her side of the story is that another girl who trained her in volunteering said no one cares if you turn up or not and no one cares if you leave early. But I pointed out the emails from the volunteer staff say it does matter that they are there and attend. She said those emails are none of my business. Which maybe they’re not but she asked me to get her the volunteer work so they come to my email. 

AITA? "
223,1jv9hw6,Asshole,WIBTA for telling my dad to not tell my mom to not go to family gatherings,"As a bit of background, my (24M) parents split when I was about 10 years old. They have both since remarried. My dad and I have had our ups and downs. Nothing terrible, just some resentful feelings on my end due to my limited perspective on the split in my early teens. As I’ve gotten older I’ve come to accept the situation more and he and I are on very good terms. We love each other very much and he has been a great resource in helping me transition to my adult life, as has my mom. 

On that note, in 2023, I graduated college and moved to the city where a lot of my dad’s extended family lives, and I’ve been able to spend a lot of time with them. My mom will also sometimes visit my grandma with me when she comes up to visit. They have been very friendly with each other when we do this, probably more than when my parents were still married. I bring this up because last summer (2024), my aunt on my dad’s side got remarried. Her new husband is a very nice man and a wonderful stepfather to my cousins. In the days leading up to her wedding, she told me that my mom and step-dad were more than welcome to come to the wedding. I thought this was a nice gesture and passed the message along to my mom.

My dad heard about this. I think it may have been from my grandma who was also there at the time, but my mom mentioned to me that he got upset. I understand his feelings (especially considering she invited my step-dad), but I told her that I believe that it’s my aunt’s special day and she can invite who she wants. (My aunt also has cancer right now, so this was a much needed positive point in a rough patch for her family). My mom opted not to come, and I think that was a valid, respectable choice that I’m confident she would have made even without my dad’s input, and I of course supported her. So I opted to not talk to my dad at the time because it would only escalate the situation. That was the end of it for a while.

Currently, my Grandpa is in hospice care and we unfortunately think he’s going to pass fairly soon. My mom is also opting to not come to the funeral, and would like to privately support my grandma by meeting up with her. This is not because of any kind of input from my dad, but her rationale is the same, that it might make things awkward. I’m much more confident that she’s making the right move this time since this is a very different kind of situation. Instead I just told her to update me if she is invited and to tell me if Dad ever says anything.

I’m not talking to my dad about her coming to the funeral. It’s his dad that’s going to die, and I think him having more of a say in something that affects him so hugely isn’t being unfair. My mom made the 100% correct move this time. But the conversation about the funeral with her had me thinking about what to do if something like the wedding happened again. Would I be the asshole for telling my dad it’s not his place to tell my mom to stay away from family gatherings if she is invited? "
224,1jv9goi,Not the A-hole,AITA for confronting my roommate about breaking roommate agreement?,"I (19f) have lived in a college dorm with my roommate (19f) since beginning last semester. While not extremely close, we were well acquainted before college, and in the time leading up to moving in we discussed moving in together and generally how we want everything to work. I made it known to her that I’m a very light sleeper and that I am easily woken up, as well as that I usually try to go to sleep by 11pm/12am at latest. She acknowledged this and said that she’d pretty much follow the same schedule. Fast forward to moving in, our college requires everyone in a dorm to make a roommate contract. We filled it out, with the main things being lights off around 10-11pm (unless we’re both busy), using airpods when watching videos/ shows, and we both have to agree on having a guest stay overnight. We both signed and turned it in, and for a while there were no issues. However, throughout the first semester, she started breaking parts of it. For example, she’d watch shows or tiktok out loud at 3 am, and when she came back from frat parties in the middle of the night she’d slam doors and turn all the lights on. I kept asking her to not do this, and she reluctantly kind of agreed and was slightly less door slammy. However, this semester has been a nightmare. She’s constantly watching her shows full volume in the middle of the night, she keeps lights on even past when she needs them on, and what has really upset me is she’s having guests over that I don’t know without asking me if it’s okay. I’m not comfortable having someone in our room that I’ve never met, especially if i don’t have a choice in the matter. I told her that i would go to the RA if it happened again because it’s clearly stated not to do that in the roommate agreement. She blew up at me, saying that she never thought i’d even go there. Additionally, she said she’s been miserable living with me because of me wanted it to be quiet and dark at night. I know I follow all the rules in our contract to a tee. When I wake up early for my classes, I make sure to get ready almost completely in the bathroom and i don’t turn any lights on. I never watch things with sound on when she’s in the room, and when I’ve had my boyfriend stay over a couple times this semester, I triple checked to make sure she was comfortable with him being there. I’m just upset that I’m being demonized for wanting to follow our roommate agreement, and that I’m barely able to sleep in my room. I get wanting to have fun in college, but there’s a way to do that and be respectful to everyone you live with. "
225,1jv9fg8,Everyone Sucks,AITA if I refused to call the dentist for my fiancé who has a impacted wisdom tooth,"First of all, I would like to say that this is ridiculous and not a big deal but for some reason it became one. I (25f) had an impacted wisdom tooth that was wrapped around a nerve. While I was pregnant. I asked him (26m) if he could call the dentist bc it hurt to talk. He said no. Now it’s 1 year later and he now has an impacted wisdom tooth and I sympathize with him but he asked me to call the dentist for him and I said no. His mom is now asking me to call for him. I said no. He’s upset about it. Does this make me an asshole? 


Edit: I ended up calling anyway because I felt bad 
Edit 2: he apologized before I called

226,1jv8w34,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling my childhood friend disrespectful for repeatedly ditching me at important events with no prior warning?,"So I (18F) and my friend (18M) have been friends since we were 7. We've done a lot of things togheter and since we were both single decided to go to prom togheter. Prom in my country consists of a dance you do in pairs and fours, and you practice said dance a few times before.

Anyway, we were pretty bad at dancing. He blamed me for a lot of things despite him messing up left and right and I had to correct him. We had a dance rehersal yesterday and he didn't show up to school. I called him, texted him etc., but he didn't answer at all. I then went home alone and apologised to our partners.

Anyway I call him and he finally answers. He says his phone was dead and he couldn't communicate and he also had a doctors appointment 5 hours before the rehersal (a checkup). He was also responding in a groupchat we're both in, but not to me. He knew of this arrangment beforehand.

I told him he was not only disrespectful to me, but also to our partners and he should apologise. He told me he's ""sorry I'm upset"" and that I'm acting childish and insulting him because I said he's disrespectful. He did not apologise to our partners either. The worst part is, I asked him if he even wanted to dance at prom, because his indifference clearly showed he didn't and one of our mutual friends told me he told her he didin't feel like going. He then got mad at HER and sent her a bunch of voice messages getting mad at her and blaming her, while not responding to any of my own.

I know I may have overreacted, but this isn't the first time he's done this. One time we had a presentation togheter in front of 30 people and he didn't show up, answer calls or anything. I had to present alone. Afterwards he scolded me for calling me because he had a migraine(has no official diagnosis despite multiple checks) and waking him up with my calls. He did not apologise.

Honestly this has been on my mind for a while and is making me quite angry. Prom is in a week and we don't know most of the moves, out partner pair is also worried and he acts like it's nothing.

TLDR: Childhood friend has been ditching me at important events with no warning and blaming me if I get upset."
227,1jv8koy,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my friends to tidy up the house a little more,"For context we are all uni students, 2 of them are friends from back home and 1 of which we’ve met during uni but are fairly close and comfortable with each other. I will refer to them as T, S and P. In general I don’t mind doing dishes and I know my friends are a bit lazier and don’t really like it so i’m fairly easy and usually am the one to do it. However, recently the dishes pile up and i’m left to clean them, even if i go away for the weekend the house remains messy and i’m usually the one that breaks and does it. Yesterday one of my friends (S) said thank you for doing them and mentioned he was thinking about doing it but was gonna do it later. I explained to him it’s alright but as all of our housemates were here I took the opportunity to have a conversation and just ask politely if everyone could just do a little bit more, not a crazy amount but if they know i’ve been away or been doing it for the most part if one of them is able to pick up some of the slack occasionally, as a joint responsibility on the 3 of them. However, when explaining this T starts to say he did tidy at the start of the semester, which in all fairness he did and he did a good job and was more on it than all of us but i definitely tried to do my own fair share during that time as well and helped him when I saw him tidying which cannot be said for when I tidy, and that this conversation doesn’t apply to him and he in general got quite defensive. Me and T have a bit of a rocky past with him being a main perpetrator of bullying me during primary school and a little bit of secondary so I tried to explain to him it’s not just him and I will give him credit that he does do more than most in the house but it’s a house discussion so I wanted to talk to everyone but he again kind of shut me down so I just left it as it was getting awkward in the room. A short while after P, who probably knows his input in keeping the house tidy is pretty minimal, did ask would it be better if we just finish washing up after we’ve finished. I briefly explained that i’m not annoyed at them and stuff and it’s not necessary for us to have rules like that, just every now and then if they know it’s just been me or that they haven’t done much in a while just to give a little bit of a hand. Just because it’s a little frustrating that it kind of feels like it’s expected of me to be the one to do them. Did i handle this in the wrong way? Should I apologise to T or ask if i’ve done something wrong that made him act a little standoffish?

TLDR: I asked my housemates to start doing a little more around the house and one got a little defensive and I don’t know if i’ve gone about it in the wrong way"
228,1jv8ek2,Asshole,AITA: unemployed partner upset about multiple alarms,"Edit: I think I’ve worded this wrong. I’m really asking aita for being frustrated at how upset my partner gets about my alarms when he can and does sleep whenever he wants (he often will sleep all day whether or not I have alarms) I completely understand where he’s coming from and don’t want to disrupt his sleep therefore I’m looking into solutions. I just wasn’t sure if any sort of my frustrations were valid. 
I work full time and have issues with sleeping through alarms. Ever since I can remember I will turn off my alarm in my sleep and have no recollection of doing so. This has made me late to work and I have extreme anxiety about being late to work. I set multiple alarms in case I turn off the one I need to wake up to. I have diagnosed ocd and will obsessively check my alarms before going to bed. Even this isn’t fool proof I have slept thru all of my alarms before it turned them off and immediately fell back asleep. Putting my alarm in another room doesn’t work because my brain will ignore it. It will just exist in my dreams sometimes and I don’t realize it’s my alarm. My partner is upset about the multiple alarms because it wakes them up. But aita? I understand where he’s  coming from but he’s unemployed so he doesn’t have to go to work and can sleep whenever he wants to. 

Edit: in case some don’t read the comments. I don’t care that my partner is unemployed I mention it only because I’ve seen posts about multiple alarms but never seen one where the partner isn’t working. I totally understand where my partner is coming from just frustrated because he can and does often sleep whenever he wants (for example sleeping all day and up all night) whether or not I have alarms. But overall I want to find a solution that benefits both of us. "

I see people are confused and saying I’m putting my gf in danger, but I didn’t let him talk to her that way, we left right after he said it, i confronted him a little after that and it didn’t go well. When I saw how he looked at her I asked her if she’d like to leave but she said no, I asked her multiple times, she wanted to meet my mom. We have moved like 200 miles from them when I first blocked them. My mom does know where we live because of personal reasons but she cannot get to where me and my gf are. We do plan to move further away. 

Also another thing yes I’m 19 and yes I’m saying fiancée but we’re not planning on having the ceremony for a while, we don’t know what’s to come but we do know we’ll be here until we cannot! 





My mom has a new boyfriend who made me and my fiancée uncomfortable. He kept looking at my fiancée up and down and also told her she doesn’t have the right to talk when she’s around him?  Every time she’d talk he had to intervene and say something so she couldn’t talk. 
My mom is homeless of right now with her new boyfriend, I told my mom she could live with us but he couldn’t and she yelled at me and told me I was ungrateful for the fact she gave birth to me she said I wouldn’t take care of her and her bf like she did when I needed her. And I just want to add I’ve been in foster care until now. "
230,1jv7y6d,Asshole,AITA for asking my friend to block my ex?,"So this happened a few months ago. My friend was not available for a few days, and I texted my then gf about the fact he hasn't replied for 2 days straight. She asked me for his name and I foolishly gave it to her, she texted him and he replied, not only to her, but me aswell, after that they started talking, which didn't bother me because I'm not the jelous type. But soon enough it became a little too personal, phone calls at night, her nagging him constantly. I only knew about it because my friend was keeping me in the loop of what she's been doing while brushing off my attempts to ask her on a date I planned. She would deny talking to him and brush me off when I brought it up, so we decided to break up. Things changed from there a lot, my friend would text someone but refuse to show me. I later found out he was still talking to her, so I asked him to stop talking to her because it was making me uncomfortable. He didn't and when I told him to block her, he said he wouldn't do that because he sees no point in blocking her. For a while things actually seemed to calm down, I was over my ex and worked on myself, I cut my long hair and dressed better. Then my ex texted me saying she saw me at the store and loved my new look, then saying she wants to give us another shot, I flat out said no. She got mad, but I stood firm. After that she started texting my friend again and once again I asked him to block her, but once again he refused, and told me I'm overreacting. So I don't know anymore, am I the asshole?"

I (F) live with three other girls. Two of them are super friendly, but one of them never talks to us, never helps, and never cleans. We have a rotating weekend bathroom cleaning schedule, and she constantly skips her turn unless we remind her days later.

She’s also left used period-stained toilet paper on the floor twice, fake eyelashes stuck to the carpet, and her hair clogs the shower. It’s gross. She didn’t buy toilet paper or soap for months even though we all share them.

I’ve tried being nice—brought her cookies, tried small talk—but she ignores us. Last week, I texted her a reminder (polite, I thought) that it was her turn to clean, since it was already Tuesday. She freaked out, told me I’m not her mom, accused me of micromanaging, and said I’ve “elected myself leader.” I said I wouldn’t have to remind her if she just did her part, and that I’m tired of cleaning up blood, hair, and eyelashes.

Now she hates me, things are super tense, and I’m questioning if I was out of line. AITA?"
232,1jv79pq,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling him out?,"Hey everyone. While this incident isn't something that really affects me, I did get curious whether I was the bad guy here or not after I discussed this with my boyfriend. 

So I recently got back to using snapchat and randomly added people from quick add. And that's how I met a dutch guy there who seemed fun to talk to in the beginning. We had stuff to talk about because both him and my boyfriend are in the airforce. When I told him that me and my boyfriend are long distance, he began telling me about his last relationship which was also a lomg distance one. And told me that ""He"" called it off after 3 months of dating cause the distance was too much for him. And I honestly get it which I told him too but also said that it'd be worth it in the end and that he picked the easy way out. 

And I guess that's okay, eventhough I think he could've spared the girl some pain by calling it off earlier. And he honestly sounded way too selfish cause every sentence was ""I said this"" ""I thought so"" ""I decided."" So I do think she dodged a bullet cause not once did he acknowledge the other person's feelings, it was all about how he felt. And mind you, he asked the girl to stay friends after and claimed that they ARE friends and do talk normal. 

Then came ""I didn't know she was so much into Hinduism when I started dating her."" And I mean that's kinda okay to say so I didn't think much of it until he said ""it was interesting until she started telling me about all these crazy rituals and THE CRAZY HINDU WEDDING."" I'm not Hindu myself but you don't have to be of a religion to respect one. 

And I'm pretty sure, since she's relgious, everything she shared about her religion must've been special to her and even the sharing part must've been something special. So it made me think, if he was able to talk so bad about those things to me who's basically a stranger, imagine the things he tells his friends and family. 

I did call him out for that behavior, I said that it felt like he based her worth solely off her beliefs. And instantly I became an ""attacker.""

Everytime I said something, his defense was ""you started attacking me without knowing the whole thing."" I mean calling a religion and its practices CRAZY is enough for me to determine how much he respects others' beliefs. 

He didn't reply to anything but just kept calling me an ""attacker"" and then removed me.

Ok OP long story short, my spouse behaves like I am an outsider, whenever speaking to my in laws. Does not share their updates with me, will cover up a conv if i come in while them talking . 

Recently my folks have come to visit. And I just got to know my spouse has planned to travel to visit them, that too without discussing or telling me. I had to find it out, from the phone conversation , as it was on speaker. This hurt me bad. They all knew, but I wasnt even consulted!
I felt like being backstabbed.

I feel my spouse is afraid to be happy with me. Afraid to be judged by my in laws. Afraid they will be sad that they are not included. Note, they live overseas. However they still control my spouse reg finances. I feel powerless. And defeated. Despite me being the spouse, I dont get to know or even be asked about how much is enough to be sent off overseas to them.I know my spouse is being used. They think its their right on their child. I think I have rights on my spouse rather.

AITA for getting hurt and withdrawing myself off completely for this reason? Am I being petty? Selfish?

We were all chilling around and I was starting to get overstimulated, going upstairs felt disrespect so I went to the only place available at that moment, the bathroom. 

I was in the bathroom for quite a while (like two hours or so) just listening to music and trying to calm my nerves, which apparently made my mum worried. I guess that made my sister mad. She accused me of taking all the attention from her because this was her special day (I do understand where she's coming from but I didn't wanna have a panic attack in front of everyone. That would probably make it even worse)

235,1jv4t1b,Asshole,AITA for telling my {f26} boyfriend {m28} that we can’t see his friend on our vacation?,"So background.
My boyfriend and I have been wanting to go to universal after we heard about the new theme park, my birthday is coming up and he said why don’t we plan something for September when it’s a little cheaper and that would be your present. I said that would be great and I would even help him pay cause he’s never been and I know it’s still going to be expensive, plus I wasn’t expecting him to pay for the full thing. Now I never ask for anything , I never expect much. But this is a supposed birthday trip for me, I started crunching numbers right away and I was excited about the trip.

I told him an estimate and what to expect when we are there, I said let’s just stay on the grounds so we don’t have to rent a car since the hotel offers shuttles to the park. Well, he had another thing in mind , he started to tell me a day after I started to crunch numbers and came up with one that he wanted to see his friend that I’ve heard him talk about all of one time and he never talks to him. Hasn’t seen him in years, now he’s talking bout renting a car , I’m like no. If he wants to see you he can meet us at the hotel, hang out by the pool, or he can meet us at the park he gets cheaper prices cause he lives there. Like I have no problem with you seeing him but I am not going around Orlando an area I don’t know for someone I’ve never met or that you don’t even talk about.

He started talking about how we went to go see my friend in Virginia, but that was the plan to start with since her mom died… like, that was what the trip was for. He was just throwing in ights, whatever’s… like I never ask for anything and you have to act like this cause I tell you no or have him meet you on the grounds? I don’t know. AITA?


Update: This guy has a car, my boyfriend is used to wanting to impress people hence why he wants to go out and rent a car and go to some fancy restaurant. He wants me there so he can show me off like he usually wants. I told him the guy can meet us , especially if the guy has a car. I only told him I don’t feel comfortable going off property, this was his idea to spend four days at the park and then we go home this whole friend thing was random and he spoke to the guy before he spoke to me about it.
  That’s what mostly bothered me.

Update 2: I took advice from the ones saying I was in the wrong, I took a look at it. I thought it over and I spoke to him, I told him we can do something with his friend the first day we are there since the guy only really wants a day with us. I told him if he wants to pick us up and we go somewhere or even do something on city walk that’s fine. We worked it out and everything is better now. Thank you all for helping me open my eyes."
236,1jv4sdf,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking my mom out of our house,"TLDR: I booted my mother out of my house last night because she's been lying to her friends and telling them I'm abusing her.

I (F63) booted my mother out of my house last night after she returned home from visiting a friend. My mother, “Uma”, lives with me, H(64), and D(30) since my dad died. We do everything for her.

Here's my problem and is why I booted her: she's been telling her friends that we are taking her money, won't feed her, won't pick up her medication, won't buy her what she needs (diapers, tea, medical supplements, etc.) One of her friends was all friendly and sweet when she picked her up but gave me filthy looks when she dropped her off. Shortly thereafter, we received a visit from Adult Protective Services. They interviewed her privately, then interviewed us (hubby and daughter) separately. I didn't connect the dots until later and confronted the woman who dropped her off. She's known us for years and fortunately was able to see Uma was weaving lies for sympathy. She also knew Uma was a hypochondriac.

Another friend dropped her off yesterday after a lengthy visit. ""Beth"" told me Mom cried the whole time because we don’t give her access to her money (she has a debit card which she’s lost several times), she hates everything we cook (we cook what she asks us to cook), and she wants her own apartment. Beth suggested we look at apartments that would suit her, but with Uma's not driving, forgetfulness, having her dog, not eating, not bathing, and having severe allergies, it's just not feasible. I WFH FT and then some and have a household of my own to tend. I don't have the time to run errands for her if they are outside of ours as well. I also cannot afford to subsidize her independent living.

She told her friends she was ""starving"" because ""we wouldn't let her eat before she met up with them at 11 a.m."" Not only did she have breakfast, which I prepared, forced her to eat, and cleaned up after it, she also had a snack in mid morning. Uma also told Beth that we won't let her have her stuff here (she's a compulsive hoarder), yet she already occupies 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms as well as the library and the Pantry kitchen. She wants us to clean out another room so she has room for her stuff. I finally blew up when I found out Uma told Beth the bruises on her arms were from us grabbing her roughly (they were from blood tests the preceding week...she's on thinners). I called my sister and told her I was done taking care of her.

My heart is breaking because I do know she mourns the loss of my dad. I also dearly love her. But I see her turn her tears on and off so easily that it seems more of a manipulation technique than of reality. When my sister showed up to pick her up, she hadn't cried a single drop. Once my sister opened the door, she started bawling, claiming she didn't know what she did wrong.

So, AITA for booting my mother to the curb?

Edit: My mother is not a candidate for Assisted Living due to multiple severe allergies. None of the local places offer meal plans accommodating anything other than cholesterol, diabetes or dairy. Cross contamination is a constant threat."

I (18f) was in bed with a migraine and feeling nauseous trying to get back to sleep after waking up and feeling awful. My mum walked in and said she’s going to the shop and I have to get out of bed. Which I responded with I’m not feeling great I’m gonna stay in bed, leading to my mum calling me lazy and telling me that I’m “always ill” as well as other things like I do nothing around the house and don’t help. I answered her explaining that I have a migraine at the moment and had suffered from it for a day now so I wanted to rest and lay in bed to recover.

238,1jv3kak,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to pay for my friend’s lawyer?,"Long story short, I bought a used car from a private seller, paying a significant amount that I had saved up. I took my mechanic friend (MF) along to help, though he wasn’t formally assisting. The seller lied (we have proof of this) and assured us the car had never been in an accident. MF wasn’t feeling well that day and didn’t check the car thoroughly but the issues weren’t visible unless you knew the cars history. We both agreed the car seemed fine. I purchased it.

When I tried to register the car in my name, I discovered I couldn’t as it had been written off in a severe accident. According to the law, the seller is required to declare this in writing before the sale, so they were in the wrong. However, the seller refuses to take the car back, and I’m now suing them in small claims court. To make matters worse, the seller is trying to shift responsibility onto MF adding him to the lawsuit. They claim that because he’s a mechanic, he should’ve known the car had been written off. Now I’m forced to be suing him as well (because the car sellers lawyer has joined him to the lawsuit).

The case is dragging on, and I’ve had to spend money on legal fees, as the other side has a lawyer, so I’ve had to hire one too. 
I offered to help MF by suggesting affordable lawyers and advising him on how to save costs. I sent him stuff to read. I even offered to assist him in writing his defence if he couldn’t afford a lawyer (as I don’t think the seller has a case against him and it’s normal to represent yourself in this small claims court) However MF acted superior and sneered at me- said I didn’t know what I was talking about. He ignored all my advice, didn’t check the lawyer’s fees, and hired the first one he met with, despite my warnings. The lawyer didn’t disclose his rates but promised it would cost less than $1,000. Now he has a $2,000 bill, mainly because he didn’t really understand the case (didn’t listen to me) and the lawyer has messed up his paperwork multiple times.

MF is hinting at me constantly that I should pay his lawyer’s fees. While I understand it’s a tough situation for both of us, I’ve been managing my own legal costs, which are much higher than his, and have done much of the work myself to save money. He can go after the car seller for his costs when we win. I’ve tried to help him throughout the process, but he rejected all my offers, didn’t follow my advice, and now expects me to cover his costs.

She texted me saying that she was moving out of his place so I called her to ask her where she would stay, she didn’t have anywhere in mind so I offered my place as a temporary arrangement.  

She moved all of her stuff, her son’s stuff and 4 cats into my house.  I used my truck to help move things because she only had a car.  I have a job so I continued to work throughout the week and would help when I could so it took about 2 weekends along with that work week.  

After everything was moved, I had told her she could move things around in the house to make it homier to help with the stress she is going through.  

After the first week of staying, her and her son decided to stop taking their medications. The first week seemed ok but the week after started to get a little crazy. She started accusing people that are family or close friends of mine that they are liars, bad people and so on. She then said that some of them would die in a car crash, seemed like that’s what she was wishing but she would say the ancestors told her in a dream and that it’s the truth and there isn’t anything I can do about it. 

After about a month of this, I blew up and said I don’t like her saying all that shit.  I asked her if I could have anyone close to me and she yea but not the ones currently.  I called bullshit and said that no one is perfect and she even agreed but then still said that shit was true about what she said. I told her I didn’t wanna hear it and she told me I could just be blind and that she’ll leave.  I said ok, she’s in her upper 40’s, grown up, if she wants to leave, she can.  I am 32.

That night she packed a few things and left, even tho I never told her to leave, just that I don’t want to be manipulated to hate everyone.  She left her son and 4 cats.  

After 3 days, my friend and I called the police and put in a missing person report because we had not heard from her.  The police did find her and let us know she was ok which was the main thing we wanted to know.  

She then shows up near the middle of the night asking for a place to stay and then take a shower. I let her and her dog that she picked up stay the night. 

I want her to take her stuff and move out but I’m ok if my nephew and the cats stay but if they wanna leave as well, they can. My nephew is 26 but is really autistic tho he can still learn and make decisions for himself. 

My sister has made some daggers towards me while in conversation tonight. I get that she’s going through a tough time but I’m not gonna be her emotional punching bag. 

Her, my brother and I saw our dad pass away and she claims that caused ptsd but that happened 3 1/2 years ago and she still has not gotten help.  "

Now this year he had decided that he did want to pursue university, however he decided to take the exact course that I am taking, which I already found odd as he never showed any interest in what I wanted to do. I quickly discovered why he had decided to pursue the course I was taking was because he assumed that I would give him all of my notes and assignments, so he could (in his words) ""get through this place as fast as possible"". I refused to share my notes because I believe that if he is in university, he should be taking it seriously. When I told Tim no, he got angry and said that I never do anything to support him.

For her birthday, and Christmas last year, I've provided lists and photos with ideas for what to get my daughter because they ask for ideas as they don't know what to get. I include prices of varying degrees because I don't know their budgets, and where to get them from. I also say it doesn't have to be from the shop I chose, if they want to look for similar things elsewhere.

I provide those ideas to both of my brothers, my mum, and my ex (my daughter's dad). My brothers choose something not in the list, but that my daughter likes. I appreciate the effort they put in especially when they don't see her often because of distance. But both my mum and my ex, instead of just choosing something and telling me what they got (so I don't get it too) they ask me to just pick something and they'll give me the money. I ask how much they want to spend etc. and never really get an answer.

Eventually I just pick something and they're okay with that, and I make sure they get the credit and ""thank you"" from my daughter. Except, I'm resenting that they're not putting in any effort.

My ex doesn't have 50/50 custody because he doesn't have space for her to stay with him or time with his altering shift pattern. My mum works part time.

She would buy us coffee or whatever and say ""Oh no I got this"" or she would ask to get breakfast or something and I would say I am broke and she would then offer to buy, sometimes we would be out with her and her boyfriend and he would offer to pay then my Fiance would say no let me pay, then her BF says NO I WILL PAY, but then the next day my friend would send a text saying how much we owed them... I never argue or make an issue about it because I avoid conflict. Keep in mind every time we would buy something for them/her we would never ask for money in return or say that they ""owe"" us.... About a month ago they did not have water where they stay and asked to come shower by us... we had to switch our geyser(water heater) on JUST so that they could have warm water, and we never asked them to pay for the electricity or water used.

POINT: We have been without electricity for a week and we don't know allot of people around to help out... I reached out to my ""best friend"" and asked if we could do a load of laundry and have a shower.... they said it is fine. The next time we asked if we could come around she said and I quote ""you can pay us at the end of the month"" (for using their utilities). I am refusing to pay them for the one time we used their shower and electricity because I WOULD NEVER have expected them to pay us. And now we have not been able to wash our clothes or shower because what ""bill"" would we receive from my ""BEST FRIEND"" at the end of the month? AITA"
244,1jv0vo2,Not the A-hole,AITA for overacting over a Facebook story my mom told me to take down?,"Context

I’m a undergrad senior (21F) with this quarter being my last quarter of classes. I was struggling to pass some of my classes. Since I’m in Comp Sci, classes are known as to be hard. In high school I was an 3.8 student. Since I’m at the point I’m internship hunting, I’m not having the best of luck.

Story
I saw a post on Instagram either a pic of Keanu Reeves’s sitting on a bench (depressingly) with the caption “while you realize you went from a ‘A+ student’ to a ‘hope I pass’ student”. I found the post funny and posted that on my instagram story (on a private account) and Facebook story. I think nothing my of it.

A couple hours later, I get a call from my mom(60F). This is how the conversation went:

Mom: “take down that post”
Me: “what post?”
Mom: “the Keanu Reeves post. Why are you announcing to the world you’re a failure”
Me: “I thought it was a funny post, and thought nothing of it. Am I not allowed to post random things I find either relatable or funny?”
Mom: “you say that you’re mature but you post whit like that.”
Me: “so with your logic, everything I post MUST be meaningful and worth enough to be in an art museum?”
Mom: “recruiters will check your social medias.”
Me: “it wasn’t an actual post. It was a story. They go away after 24 hours unless I save it to my account. Did I save it? No! In fact JUST FOR you, I’ll take it down”

After that I hung up on her and deleted only from my Facebook story and not my instagram story. She called again but I didn’t answer.

Did I overreact or what is my mom who overreacted? I don’t think I’m the ass here.

245,1jv09au,Not the A-hole,AITA for not bringing anything to my friend’s potluck after she told me not to?,"One of my close friends hosted a dinner at her place last weekend. She called it a “potluck” and sent a group text saying we should each bring a little something, drinks, snacks, whatever. It wasn’t anything fancy, just casual. I asked her what I should bring and mentioned I’d be coming straight from work and might be a little rushed. She replied that I didn’t need to worry about it, she had plenty of food and just wanted me to come.

So I didn’t bring anything. I showed up, said hi to everyone, and honestly, the night was going fine. People brought stuff, a salad, some cupcakes, a couple bottles of wine. I was planning to just help clean up or do dishes since I didn’t bring anything, and I figured she meant what she said.

But later on, while people were complimenting the food, she made this offhand comment like, “Well, not everyone contributed… but we’re still glad she showed up.” Everyone laughed, and it didn’t seem super serious, but I felt my face get hot. I didn’t know how to respond.

I stayed polite and tried not to act weird about it, but I felt uncomfortable the rest of the night. On the way home, I kept thinking about it. I get that maybe she was a little annoyed, but she literally told me not to bring anything. And now I feel like she put me on blast in front of people for something I didn’t even do wrong.

I haven’t said anything to her yet because it feels small and I don’t want to be dramatic, but I also can’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t fair.

AITA?"

and my mom has notciced that and offered me a deal where I move in and take care of my sister once she leaves to go live my step dad in a few months due to her not being able to support her self and my sister once she moves up there and I wouldn't have to pay rent . So I hoped on that and moved in scenar then she has told me that scents she helped with the down payment of my car I have to help her or she will report It stolen if I don't have the house perfect clean .now she has been hiding my keys telling me to take Uber or be fired.

so reddit should I be the a hole for saying I would help out with my sister and the house a little for free rent but now that she is counting my car and life due and becaee of that I want to move out even if that means she can't afford to get by living with my step dad."
247,1juzm2s,Not the A-hole,"AITA for setting a firm boundary, pissing off my supervisor?","USING A THROWAWAY FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. 

I work at a very chill business, and my direct boss and I are friendly. I’ve been with my current bf about 5 months but we were best friends for over a year before we decided to be together. We met on Facebook dating went on a date and decided to be friends and became best friends. We’re talking about the serious topics like marriage and kids as in we want them in a few years not next week. I’m 23f he’s 25m. 

My boss overheard a phone call on my break when I was in the other room where we were talking about the people I live with not being the best and threatening to kick me out for working so much and not being home more than nights really. So he offered to let me stay with him if that happens, and I said “if they do end up doing that I’ll stay with you but i also have rooms with grandparents and a best friend I can stay with. Plus I want to wait to live together.” They say 20 minutes later “you should never have those conversations until you’ve been dating at least 4 years.” And then asks if we’ve talked about marriage and kids. I said yes because it’s a deal breaker with differences in choices on those topics and we had those talks when we were best friends in a friendly way and we sat down and intentionally made sure we were on the same page 3 weeks ago to make sure we were compatible. And left it at that. 

2 days later they pull me over and say that “so and so didn’t even do this until 6 years in” or “so and so didn’t even do this until 3 years in”. I just look at them like “what..?” 

I told her not everyone shares their ideals and I respect that they care enough to say something and appreciate it very much however me and my boyfriend F are on a path that is intentional and will go at the pace that suits us. 

They said “well the last one you moved way too fast. I don’t believe the last guy was as bad as you made him out to be so what’s to say it won’t happen again” 

This hurt, last year I had a severe DV relationship with my ex fiancé and it ended in him cheating for 2 months with someone twice his age while I was pregnant and led to a miscarriage I do not like people comparing my current relationship with T to this one. I currently have charges being pressed on my ex fiancé but he jumped the state to avoid them. I do not stand for them comparing the amazing man I’m with now to that horrible person. 

I told them to stop firmly and I will not entertain condescending words or bringing up past trauma. 

Now they are acting extremely cold and saying “I just wanted to help” in a condescending way. 

I’m a people pleaser and know I should have shut that conversation down right away. 

AITA for setting that boundary firmly? I feel horrible that I may have upset them by being firm about it but I’m genuinely just not sure."
248,1juz1sa,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my friend she’s toxic,"My friend, f20, is in a relationship with a guy, m28, and she treats him horribly. She called him early in the morning and said she was in a good mood because of free will (idk) and got mad when her boyfriend responded negatively. When she told me and asked my opinion, I told her they’re both childish but to say she’s totally in the right would be wrong, since she does treat him horribly. 

For instance, she gets mad every time he says no to having sex with her or sending her stuff. And they’ve been on and off for a while. So I made her aware of her behavior, and called her out for being toxic. But she did respond well, and called me an asshole since it’s none of my business. But I feel like since she’s telling me these things and complaining, I also should be allowed to criticize her? Am I the asshole?"
249,1juyzgq,Asshole,AITA for not letting my ex talk about me?,"Last year I went on a tv show with my new gf and we got some attention from it. As soon as it came out my ex started commenting on everything telling everyone that we lied to get on the show. 

Back when me and her were still dating I asked her if she would be mad if that girl and I lied to get on the show and she said ""I don't care as long as you guys don't hook up"" but then 2 years later when the episode came out she was fine with telling everyone that it was a lie. 

When she was commenting on everything alot of people asked her to make videos to prove that we dated and she did, but in the video she said that I was manipulative when we were dating and that she wanted to warn people so that we couldn't use them or manipulate them. We put Amazon links in our Instagrams so that people could donate to our baby registry and she used that as an example. 

She also like 5 months before the show aired would warn people at work about me. From her perspective she thinks that I did something bad to her (I remember it different). She accused me of cheating and said that it was because I was talking to the girl while she and I were dating on a daily basis and it was suspicious that I started dating that girl after we broke up. 

She sent me a text before the show talking about things that happened in our relationship and my friends told me to just give short answers because she couldn't be reasoned with and that was my mistake because now not denying those things can be used against me. 

Her side of the story is that she's doing this to prevent people from being manipulated and she has screenshots of things that can work against me. But it's been almost a year since the show happened and she's still talking about me like she's obsessed with me. My friends are making accounts to tell her to leave me alone but now she's saying that I'm harassing her and that she's scared. AITAH?

Edit: I mean it's been years since we broke up but it's only been like 10 months since she told everyone that I lied to get on the show and since then she's still talking about it by replying to comments from people asking about it

250,1juytiq,Not the A-hole,AITA for going behind my mom’s back to dye my hair?,"For context, I am a senior in high school and about to leave for college. I have never gotten any sort of hair dye done before, and my mom has always been a firm no when I have asked. I was hanging out with a friend who is a hairstylist recently, and they offered to highlight my hair for free. I didn’t want to turn it down, as getting your hair highlighted is expensive in a salon. I didn’t do too much, just a few strands lightened. 

I figured as I have been 18 for awhile and about to leave for college, that getting a few highlights wouldn’t be that big of a deal. I thought that once she saw it she wouldn’t be so mad since I at least thought it looked really good. 

To my dismay, my mom did not like that I got my hair highlighted and was extremely upset, screaming and crying, saying that she felt betrayed, that I let her down and that maybe she had wanted to do that with me. I never knew that it mattered that much to her, and she never indicated that she ever wanted to go get my hair highlighted with her. To be honest, I didn’t think she’d even be that mad as I got it for free, and one of the reasons she didn’t want me to get it done was because it cost so much. I know it's not a good idea to lie and betray someone's trust in general, but this wasn't really a pre-mediated decision. Me and my friend had briefly talked about it in the past few weeks, and she happened to offer it up today. I know I should have asked her first, but I already knew what the answer would be, and as an adult about to live on my own I feel as if I should be able to make some of these decisions for myself. I just feel really bad about it now because she was bawling saying that she wanted to be there for that and was disappointed in me, felt betrayed etc. I didn't understand it was that important to her.

I apologized to her several times and said that I’m sorry that I didn’t ask her, and again that I didn’t think it mattered like that to her. She is still angry and upset and I don’t know what else I am supposed to do.

So, AITA?"
251,1juyj42,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my girlfriend to stop venting with her friends,"

My girlfriend regularly vents to more then one friend often telling her entire friend group personal issues were going through. I’m okay with her having a few conversations about our relationship but quiet frankly it feels like the whole world knows our business. She says it’s her just venting but I feel like she just wants reassurance from anyone who will listen about how much of an asshole I am. We often get into arguments over this issue since I feel I can’t express myself knowing that she will inevitably tell everyone everything no matter how big of an issue we’re having. I asked her to please stop telling so many people when a conflict or disagreement happens between us but am not sure if that’s the right thing to do. Am I being controlling? Am I the asshole for asking her to stop “venting” with all of her friends? "

253,1juxpkk,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my coworker about an experience I had with another coworker borrowing money and not returning it?,"For context, my coworker (36 F) borrowed $40 from me (18 F). I let her, since she mentioned it was for her children. For two weeks straight,
she repeatedly would tell me she would pay me back the next day (which she did not)

A few days ago, I was in the takeaway room (for context, I work at a chain restaurant as a hostess) and a few people in there were talking about their experiences with lending her money. I proceed to tell them mine, to which make another co worker angry enough to take it to management.

I ended up being paid back due to management saying something. The issue is, and where I may be the a-hole, is that she actually told me not to tell anyone nor take it to management. Now, she is telling people that I am lying, so I don’t know what to do. Aita?

Ps: This may be unimportant, but she has made several remarks about my anxiety and a few about my appearance. I remember when I trusted her more, I told her about a crush I had, and she proceeded to tell everyone there, including him, about it.

Update/ TY so much for ur support yall! shes telling people now she never borrowed from me, so i don’t really know anymore. i hope it brushes off."
254,1juxfhb,Not the A-hole,AITA for yelling at my group mate because I don’t like women touching me?,"I 20M am no longer a practicing Muslim, but growing up, my parents were extremely strict. I wasn't allowed to touch or be touched by the opposite sex, and I was homeschooled, so it wasn't an issue growing up (and yes, of course I can touch my mother, and accidents are okay, but should be avoided).A girl in my study group, ""Jenna,"" keeps touching my arm to get my attention. I didn't say anything at first because I'm trying to allow myself more freedom now, but it's gross. My family was never physically affectionate, and we only touched each other if it was necessary, and I probably also inherited my mother's fear of uncleanliness. So whenever she touches me, it's extremely irritating. I don't know if she's a clean person or not.

Eventually, I asked her to stop touching me, and she forgot each time, but she always apologized. Last week, I couldn't help it, though. She's an in-hand-cough person, and when she touched me this time, I jerked away and told her not to touch me. I wasn't being polite anymore because I was angry, so I yelled at her and pushed her hand back. Then everyone got quiet, so I left early. I tried to explain in the study chat because everyone was asking me why I was so mad. I'm very quiet, so it was understandable it upset them, but I really didn't want to explain and decided to just be brief: ""I don't like women to touch me, it's against my religion"" was exactly what I said. They all said that wasn't a good reason and that I was being sexist. Even one of my actual friends, also a woman, got angry as well, and I did feel guilty and apologized to her. But for the rest, I'm not sure what I should apologize for. I don't feel like it's asking for women to be separated from society or isolated; just that, personally I don't like being touched by women."

Some litters in my garage, some in  another neighbors garage. I took ""our"" cats in and fixed - they now live indoors with us (grrrr).

Other neighbor took their ""surprise"" straight to a rescue 6-minthe ago.

Welp, the newest litter has been kept hidden by the ""offending"" neighbor for weeks it seems and this new cat family ended up in my garage again nesting to my surprise.

I caught the kittens and found a rescue, and same day turned them over.  I've now asked the neighbor to make an appointment to get the mother fixed or I will be trapping.

256,1juwki0,Not the A-hole,AITA for cussing out my friend in public,"this might be kind of winded but i’ll try to break it down as best as i can

i go to a university where i am required to get internships in order to graduate and i had been struggling to get a job for the summer time. i had expressed to all my friends to let me know if there was anyone i could get in contact with to finally land a job. all my friends knew that i was struggling to get a job and they tried to help me as much as they can.

i had applied to over 300 jobs at this point and only gotten like 3 interviews. i was frustrated but kept pushing on because i knew i needed this job for my degree. eventually one day, i got a call telling me i had gotten an interview. upon hearing this i was too excited to double check the company and was just happy i had gotten an interview.

the person on the other side on the line told me i had gotten an interview for a data analyst position (a position that i wanted so bad) and they asked me what days i was available for an interview. i told them what days i was available and we chose a day to have the interview. the person on the other line also told me they would send an email with all the details for the interview after the call. i ended the call and told my roommate at the time that i had gotten an interview and she got happy for me. i was also so happy that i told my mom.

i didn’t get the name of the company so i went on the job board i applied to hoping to find a match. i was also waiting on the email that would be sent to me by the recruiter. i had waited 5 mins and still had not gotten an email, then i noticed my phone ringing again. it was the number of the recruiter that called me and i picked up as soon as i saw it. at first all i heard was silence and then i heard a familiar voice saying oh it was a joke. it was my friend i heard on the line now.

i was obviously upset and chose not to say anything on the call and went on about my day. i had a hackathon to work on at the time so i tried to let this not get to me. i am now with a couple of my friends (who i am doing the hackathon with) and updating them on what had happened to me that day. they were obviously sympathetic to my situation and tried to make me feel better. 

next thing i know my friends are quiet looking behind me and i turned back looking at what they are looking at. it was the friend that did the joke trying to surprise me like nothing happened. i am someone who tends to get very agitated and all my friends know that. seeing this friend made me so angry that i yelled at them to get the f away from me in the middle of the student center. everyone around me went quiet and the friend left looking sad. 

i know that i did was bad but it felt justified to me in the moment. am i the asshole?

p.s. i am still friends with this person

257,1juw43c,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling my sister selfish over soda?,"I 17 (NB) and my sister Sarah,for this post that's her name, 13 (F) have always have been at odds from her not flushing the toilet and smearing blood all over it (Again she's 13 she knows better) to her telling me ""At least I live with my dad."" For context My mother left the bio sperms doner who doesn't deserve being called a bio dad when I was a year old and my actual dad has been with us since. I've never known any other than him and she was born 3 years after this. She has a complex for this since I'm a wasian and she's fully white. I think she looks down on me and my other sister who is a year younger. I am a Germaphobe and even the thought of something in my food or drinks or anything I touch makes me repulsed. I had gotten one cup of soda from the soda bottle bought recently and went to get another when it disappeared from the counter. I went to ask her but she said she didn't have it but after finding it open next to her I knew what she did. She drank HALF OF IT bottle straight to mouth instead of getting a cup and planned to keep it all to herself. She has constantly done shit like this and then goes and tell her therapist how she ""Always wants my approval"" and that I'm a horrible sibling when she's lied, overstepped boundaries, has a complex because she's fully white and fully related to both parents, and has stolen from me and my sister and even my parents on multiple occasions so every bit of rage from the past 13 years of her being the parents favorite and her blatant selfishness I snapped. I went on on how she was a selfish bitch who didn't care about others unless she got her way and now I couldn't drink it because of the fact I'll only think of her backwash in it. (I know she does because I've seen her doing it). She knew i hated her drinking from the bottle and told her on multiple occasions to not do that but she never listened. I listen to her various boundaries and try to be corgel but I can't anymore but I still shouldn't have said some of those things and now I'm second guessing the more I think about it. AITA?"
258,1juw07z,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I didn't invite my mom to my wedding?,"I posted about my mom on here last year that I now call the birthday that broke me. but now I face a new deleema. I have been with my fiance for almost a year, and a few weeks ago he asked me to marry him. I am so excited for the wedding, and of course I wanted to involve my mom in this. My mom has been trying to fix our relationship, but I think she finally put the nail in the coffin of it instead.

When I told my mom that I thought my fiance was going to ask, she said ""He hasn't broken up with you yet?"" When my fiance asked, I took a pic of the ring on my finger, and sent it to my mom (and everybody else) and what did mommy dearest say? ""And you said yes?""

The proposal happened the weekend before my birthday, and my mom wanted to take me out to dinner. Of course, the topic of my wedding came up, and I told my mom where the wedding would be (a 2 hour drive away from her house) and she said ""that's way too far"" with my step dad adding ""not for a day trip, no way."" I told them they didn't have to go, we finished lunch, and then they complained that lunch for 4 was almost $100, which is average in our town. I offered to pay and my mom said ""no, it's your birthday lunch.""

So my question is WIBTA if I just didn't invite them since they don't want to drive that far for ""a day trip""?"
259,1juw00f,Not the A-hole,AITA for not watching my sister's dog?,"My sis and I have always had dogs. These days, she has a dog “Bud” that I spending time with. So, occasionally, if my schedule permitted, I'd watch Bud when she traveled. However, she eventually just would either spring watching Bud on me at the last minute, or drop him off for days at a time, again, without asking. As much as I loved Bud, it was a pain for me because I had to go home to let him out or change my plans to be sure I was home to feed him and take him for walks. I wouldn't have cared if she ASKED first, but she just assumed I would do it all the time and it was both annoying and made me feel unappreciated and taken for granted.

A few years later, I married and settled down. My husband and I adopted a dog “Daisy.” Daisy was a sweet pound pup with one flaw, she HATED other dogs. So, having Bud at my house for any length of time was a no-go and my sister even got mad at me saying I purposely adopted Daisy so I wouldn't have to care for Bud anymore. That truly wasn't the case. Daisy was in a bad situation that she needed to get out of quickly, so we took her in knowing nothing of her personality or quirks. She really was a fantastic dog except for despising other dogs!

Miraculously, in the wake of this, my sister found a dog sitter on one of the dogsitting sites who was great. She was flexible, adored Bud and was a reasonable price, but she wasn't FREE, so my sister was still kind of salty about all of it but it's part of owning a dog. The cost is not at all a hardship for her, she  just doesn't WANT to spend the money on it.

Sadly, Daisy passed away a couple of months ago. She was an old girl and didn't have a lot of time left when we took her in, but the loss still hurts. Well, my sister has ALREADY asked if my husband and I will watch Bud this summer when she goes away in June. Honestly, I don't want to go down that path again because we'll end up right where we started, with her dropping Bud off when ever she wants and as long as she wants. I just don't want to deal with any of it. Bud is great, but if I wanted a dog, I'd HAVE a dog. Frankly, it's kind of nice to have a bit of a break from caring for a dog until my husband and I are ready to adopt again. She has done this with other things and there is no indication she is willing or able to change her ways, so I know she will go back to her old ways, and quickly. AITA for telling my sister NO to watching Bud and having her book with her dog sitter?"
260,1juvxt6,Not the A-hole,AITA for ignoring my best friends?,"i’ve recently got back from my senior trip funded by our school on a cruise ship, and didn’t hang out with both my best friends even though we promised to do so much together. 

we were texting so much before i got there and when i arrived on the first day, i texted immediately and they seemed really happy. i was eating with my mom and she sees them walk past. she tells me that my 2 best friends are there and i almost fall chasing them, and when i get to them, they look back at me and just got back to what they were doing. i walked away immediately because i felt so embarrassed that i was so happy to see them and that they didn’t feel the same way. my mom sees it all happen and she got extremely upset and started crying. 

seeing her break down in the restaurant made me cry as well because why did they act like they didn’t even care about me? later on one of the girls aunts tells me that we weren’t showing up to the timed dinners. for the past few days neither one of the girls family’s confirmed or reached out to me that they were expecting my mom and i!! so when her aunt invited me, she told me that the girl would send me a text. she never did, so my mom and i try to find them in the dining room which had THREE huge floors just to see they didn’t even save seats for us. and after the cruise they didn’t want to talk to me either, they only talked to me when i talked to them so it really just made me think they wanted nothing to do with me. 

but because my school is so small, i literally don’t have anywhere else to go and i just acted like everything was okay even though my feelings were hurt."
261,1juvnj2,Not the A-hole,AITA for planning a trip on my birthday that just so happens to fall when religious speakers are coming to visit my grandma’s home?,"I (24f) am turning big 25 in a few months. Of course since it’s an important birthday I’ve been planning a trip for my actual birthday. My very religious family suddenly releases information that a few religious speakers we’ve known for YEARS are coming to stay over at my  grandparents home and hosting a three day prayer event. On the same day of my birthday and the weekend of it. These speakers come almost 2-3 years to my grandmas and hosts prayer functions frequently there. Since we’re close family, we’re expected to attend always to help set up and stay for the duration. 

My mother mentioned it to me while we were driving home and I said “oh it’s on my birthday! I’m actually already planning a trip those dates”. My mom got FURIOUS. She started saying “You can’t do that, it’s an important event!!” 

I stated again, “but I’ve already been planning it for a while and… it’s my literal birthday.” She got even more upset and started saying I have no respect for family or for religion. She also said I’m being disrespectful and I have to come because it doesn’t look good. I just responded with the same thing saying “…but it’s my literal 25th birthday and I made this plan before I was even informed.” 

I respect my family and religion, but I unfortunately will not be spending my Big 25 praying from morning to noon, and that too for three days straight. Of course I may sound rude but this has nothing to do with respect for my religion. Our family hosts religious events ALL. YEAR. AROUND. Also attends. And these speakers come very frequently. I feel selfish and guilty for even going now. But I know I’ll have deep resentment and sadness if I have to spend my big birthday in a way I will not enjoy.  I know I’m being stuck up but please bare with me. Ive been looking forward to my birthday so much. So I have to ask, does me going on a bday vacation during this religious event make me the AH? Just the thought of having my family explain to ppl I’m gone on vacay while the event is going on, makes me feel sooo selfish. Like I’m being self centred. But I can’t help to feel that I’m still deserving of enjoying my 25th birthday. 

Edit: there’s a lot of people saying this is cult like but I can assure you it’s nothing like that. I’m brown and Hindu. There are multiple festivals that last days that also involve prayers in our religion. Saying I’m or my family in a cult is a stretch but I can see how it comes off that way 😭"
262,1juurk1,Asshole,AITA… My girlfriends family hates me and when I retaliate I’m in the wrong,"So for a basis I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about 3 months but we’ve known each other for about two years now and we started dating recently. We are quite young so we communicate mainly through calling but my girlfriend is the type of person to get in trouble a lot so she doesn’t have a phone very often. When we do get to chat her family doesn’t really respect her privacy and on one of our more recent calls her older sister decides to loudly scroll on tik tok next to my girlfriend while constantly butting into our conversation. I made up some excuse to leave because I was getting a headache and I’m afraid of confrontation. I texted my girlfriend later asking her that next time if we called could her sister not be a dick (I asked that in a nicer way ofc) but apparently the way I said it was a little harsh so we started arguing and we ended with her saying she is really close to her family and she doesn’t like me being rude to them. For context for the entirety of our relationship her family has said they either don’t like me in front of my face, made fun of me, or just outright ignored me. Am I in the wrong here? We’re back in good terms but her family(mainly the sister) still doesn’t talk to me and treats me like shit and I don’t want to bring it up in fear of another argument.
Also I just needed to type it out to see if I’m crazy, I don’t need advice because I have a therapist for that, I just want to know if I’m in the wrong."
263,1juujo5,Not the A-hole,AITA for putting a gift in the back of my closet?,"Hi everyone, I (f22) got scolded (yup) for putting a gift from my sil (f26) in the back of my closet and I genuinely do not know if I deserved to get told off or not.

I'm a huge Formula 1 fan, but I haven't invested in merch because I can't justify paying for something I probably won't actually wear. My brother (32) got married last year and my sil is the sweetest person ever who loves gift giving, but she is a bit stubborn.

I.e. Last year she bought me an F1 sweatshirt that was way too big for me (I wear small and she bought a men's large) because ""girls love oversized stuff"" (my brother had warned her that it would be too big and that I don't wear baggy clothes). It's a white sweatshirt and I don't want to get it dirty, so I have it hung in the front of my closet as something pretty to look at and appreciate. I didn't say anything about the sizing to her, I let it be.

This time, she bought me a hat of the team that is the rival of my favourite team. I know it's just a sport but I despise this team and make it known. Again, I didn't say anything and I even sat it on my desk for a few days until I needed the space and put it in the back of my closet with the rest of my hats. Apparently she overheard me offerring it to one of my friend's who actually likes that team and she cried to my brother and mom about it. I wasn't actively trying to pawn it off, I just mentioned that I now possessed one and that if they truly, they could have it.

My parents and brother all gave me a lecture about how I should have appreciated the gift, but what about her acting on a whim (I know this sounds immature)? My brother told me that he was with her and they weren't fully sure, so she just picked up what she thought was prettiest (it's an orange hat?). He told her to wait to be sure, but she insisted that it was probably this team because the drivers are both young and popular, so I'd probably like it anyway. Even my dad initially told my brother that they couldn't have picked a worse piece of merch to give me. I feel like this was all avoidable if she had listened to my brother or even me when I said that I do not want F1 merch (she has seen me look at merch and put it away).

Again, I genuinely wasn't mad about the merch, but I'm really annoyed about getting told off now. Aita?

Edit: Apparently I excluded a lot.

 When I offered the hat to my friend, I was on call with my headphones in my room with the door locked. The only way she could have heard this conversation is if she was outside my door. I think she was going downstairs and passed my door and that is how she heard it because her room is on the other side of the house. I wouldn't have made a show in front of her of giving it to someone else. Plus she has given me gifts I've loved and used a lot, it's just the ones I don't use, I still get flack for. In some of these cases, I tried to exchange them, but she's very emotional and I've been told to just leave it be."
264,1juud0z,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I told my boyfriend's mother the real reason I don't want to be around.,"I am 19f and my boyfriend 22m and my boyfriend's grandmother doesn't like me. My boyfriend currently lives with his grandmother before he leaves for the military. Around my boyfriend birthday I was told I wasn't allowed to come to his birthday dinner because his grandmother would be there and she didn't want to see me. It confused me because I have been nothing but kind to his grandmother and showed the utmost respect to her, but out of the blue she didn't want to see me. I cried and had a fight with my boyfriend about me not coming because I wanted to make it a special night for his first birthday as his first girlfriend. He explained to me that he lost the magic of his adult birthdays and I wanted to do my best to be there and make it special. I wasn't given an explanation on why until a week later when his grandmother told him and his mother that she didn't see potential in me. To add details in this story I'm black and my boyfriend, along with his family, are Puerto Rican. That reason didn't make sense to me because I graduated high-school a year early and excelled in math& science. I was in honor and advanced classes throughout my high-school and middle school years and she knows all of my achievements. My boyfriend did not do well in high-school and finished with an average GPA. I tried to excuse it because of my age but I realized I'm a young adult growing into the best version of myself. Even if she didn't see potential in me, why does me being around the family bother her? I love my boyfriend and he's a caring man, but I ultimately don't feel comfortable around his family anymore. His mother loves me and his father likes me but I feel like it was unjustified to exclude me for a petty reason and everyone is saying it's because she's from an older generation. I told him that I didn't want to be around anymore and he said that it would cause problems because his mothers asks about me. His mother doesn't know how I feel about the situation and how it affected me. So would I be in the wrong bring up old problems to explain to her why I don't want to be around?"
265,1juu180,Not the A-hole,AITA for upsetting my friend,"I 17f have recently been confronted by my friend via Snapchat about everything I have done wrong in our relationship which includes the following: lying, talking to her boyfriend too much, and telling others what's going on with her. When it comes to the lying I in no way intended to hurt her nor did I realize I was doing it, I am autistic and have personality issues that make it difficult to phrase sentences and remember details(not an excuse for what happened but just some added information about me that could impact the situation). As for what the 'lies' were about it was details such as when someone told me something or who told me something, I made it clear to my friend that I forget and/or mess up details on occasions due to having some memory problems caused by my personality disorder. When it comes to her boyfriend, she personally gave me his contact info to talk to him, I literally send him a snap and talk randomness with him for like 5 minutes day(I spend much more time talking to her). When it comes to sharing parts of her private life it was explaining to my boss and one co worker why she was not at work, I only said it was migraines and nothing else as to respect her privacy. I never wanted to hurt her and she just now told me after 6 months of friendship. I take time out of my day when she isn't feeling good to bring her pick me ups and snacks(probably every other week), I am constantly giving her small gifts and food, and I am always looking for ways to be there for her. After she shared this confrontation with me I apologized and explained my point of view, I also told her that I removed her bf from my contacts and would take a step back and give her space. I am so scared that I hurt her but I also realize how I could've come off even though she knew my about my personality issues and autism. Was I the asshole?"
266,1jutz0c,Asshole,WIBTA for being mad that I got kicked out of a lunch group chat?,"I'm using a burner account for this because I don't want anything about either party to sway any opinions including gender, age, religion, race, or anything else, we're all just blank slate people for this.

This group chat started as a place for a group of I believe 5 or 6 to share a daily lunch location. Over time, it grew to include 9 people, including me, with extra people who couldn't join or chose not to. It also became a chat space, and the lunch location became less important as we found a regular spot.

Around mid-February, I got a concussion on my own, which was my fault and not related to the group. However, when I went back to school, it was really hard for me to get through the day because I would have 4 back-to-back periods before lunch where all I did was stare into a screen and use my brain. Because of how I was feeling by lunch (not-so-great), I would go through the shortest lunch line, quickly eat whatever I got, then go to the nurse's office to lie down for the rest of my break. I explained this situation to most of the group chat members in person including the person who would end up removing me from the group chat.

Two weeks later, I saw I was added back to the group chat shortly after being removed (which was how I found out I was ever removed) with a message saying I was part of their group whether I wanted to be or not. I left, got added back, was asked if I was leaving for real, then I left again.

A month later, the person who removed me apologized over text. They started it by saying a mutual friend made them apologize. They thought removing me was the only thing to do since the group chat was for people who were there during lunch and they didn’t know I had a concussion. However, I remembered that person telling the entire group chat and spreading the news that I had a concussion. Filtering to that group and searching for “concussion”, I easily found the texts. I know they couldn’t have forgotten because some of the people there reminded the person before they removed me of my concussion and asked them not to do it.

At the time I didn't care about being kicked from the chat. It had stopped bothering me for good after a day or two, and I hadn't brought it up very much because I just didn't care. I still don't care about it, which is why I'm posting this.

People I talk to keep mistaking the things I say for me being mad that I was kicked out of the group chat, and their answers to that ""question"" have been very different than what I expected, but I think they're opinions on the two of us are contributing to that answer. Which is why I want to ask here, WIBTA for still being mad that I got kicked out of the lunch group chat?

Not upset, not disappointed, not sad, but mad as in angry and ready to yell at them over it."
267,1jutinq,Not the A-hole,AITA I threw away a hamper full of clothes and my mom got mad,"I was cleaning. Our house isn't the cleanest, and it's mostly clutter.

So I was cleaning the bathroom and looked at an old hamper full of clothes.

It was originally in our washroom but moved to our bathroom. It's full of old dirty clothes that have been sitting in there for maybe a couple years now.

They've been collecting dust, and some items even smelled like cat piss. It smelled awful and like I said, has been sitting untouched for years.

So I threw it away. The next day my mom was upset. Saying that I threw away perfectly good clothes. And how I always throw away things when I clean.

And she brought up how I'm always throwing away sauce packets. Which we by the way also NEVER use. She told me, ""throwing things away, isn't cleaning.""

But I think if we don't use it, it's trash. Am I the asshole? "
268,1jushd8,Not the A-hole,AITA for not allowing my SIL to visit with her partner,"Hi all, you're probably reading this and thinking wtf, allow me to add context to this.
I (33m) am married to my wife (31f) and we live a bit away from family. Lately there's been a discussion about my SIL coming to visit. Now, the problem is not with my SIL but her partner who is... overbearing is a kind word for this.

SIL (35F) is with an older man (50s), they're together two years and he's gotten extremely nasty to her, obsessive even. SIL's partner, we'll call him Randy, is obsessively controlling, constantly watching her every move and notion and is also very creepy. 
To give a rather messed up situation, he constantly texted and called the night SIL lost her grandpa, even calling my wife that night in the midst of the tragedy. Randy has also been putting a wedge and rifts between her friends and SIL's, even fueling negative perspectives of people.

Randy is even paranoid and weird when SIL visits family, goes for a walk and is now policing her 6 year old son (not his bio kid), who is now talking back to Randy out of defense. Randy paints a tough guy image but is incredibly insecure about SIL speaking to other men, and people in general.

I told my wife today I would be actively objecting to them visiting, because:

A - I don't want that drama or overbearing behaviour in our household.

B - Randy is incredibly critical and c*nty about things, giving unwanted opinions and criticism of everything (it runs deeper than you think)

C - Randy is creepy with comments, he makes overly sexual jokes and oversteps. I plain and simply don't want that in my Wife and I's home. 

I have told my wife I am willing to fully shoulder that objection of a visit including Randy, and if there's any backlash, I will deal with it.

***IMPORTANT NOTE***
I have no issue with SIL or her 6 year old son coming as a pair, my nephew is an incredibly sweet boy and I hate that he's even caught in that situation. I don't think it would be fair or a decent family visit with Randy in-tow because of aforementioned reasons.

AITA? "
269,1jus0cl,Everyone Sucks,AITAH for fighting over a walk in the rain?,"Me (F22) and my boyfriend (M24) have been together for 3 years now. I’m currently enrolled in college and my bf graduated from his associates program. The only time I have to see him is the weekends so we typically spend Friday evenings into Sunday afternoons with each other. He is welcome to stay at my dorm but we typically go over to his family’s house where he lives with his parents. 

Last weekend was cold and rainy. We planned to just hangout, play games, maybe go see some friends. Keep it easy. Friday into Saturday was very normal. His parents were happy to see me, asked me about college, life, etc. Saturday morning is where something changed. 

I tend to sleep through most of the morning. I go to bed late because of my coursework and to be able to spend all weekend with my boyfriend. My boyfriend knows this. I get up around my usual 10am, we eat breakfast and hangout in my bf’s basement where he has an entertainment area. My bf goes upstairs to go to the bathroom but when he comes back down his vibe was off. He stands in front of me and tells me we must leave the house, and I have to decide what we do. I throw out some options (the mall, the arcade, paint pottery place, a movie, etc.) he shoots all my ideas down. He tells me he doesn’t want to spend any money or he’s just not interested in doing my ideas. He stands there, arms folded waiting and expecting me to plan a whole day of activities last minute. I asked him to please help me, I’m not from the area and I was running out of ideas. 

He then finally tells me his mom wants him to go for a walk. I tell him I don’t want to go for a walk in the rain, the clothes I brought are okay for being outside momentarily, but not good for anything more than a light mist. He tells me that’s not an excuse and his mother insists that we go for a walk around the neighborhood instead of being lazy inside all day. I told him I don’t appreciate his mother implying I’m lazy, as I sacrifice a lot to spend time with him, help him host his parties, and just be a good girlfriend. Plus, I’m juggling coursework, while also doing my best to care for my health. I’m in no way out of shape and feel I should have a day to relax with my boyfriend. This doesn’t phase him. I eventually relent and we go for a cold, wet walk. 

After we return I asked him why he didn’t just say he wanted to go for a walk. He shrugged sheepishly and said he felt like he was always planning things and wanted me to plan something. I told him that’s not true, I planned this weekend after last week when I asked him what he wanted to do and he said he didn’t know. He just kind of stopped talking after this. Historically, if I were to push for a real answer out of him, he’d meltdown and tell me he’s just trying to be a good boyfriend. So the conversation ended. 

I’m starting to wonder if I should have just said yes to the walk and bit the bullet. His mother seems upset with me because he likely told her that we had a fight about going for a walk."
270,1jurop9,Not the A-hole,AITA for saying i don't want a retirement party,"Throw away account 


I recently retired my wife mentioned a retirement party. I  love to cook bbq,  I have a custom built smoker it's my passion.  I said to my wife we'll wait until summer the pool will be open and I'll cook.  I've done it before for our kids graduation party and her parents anniversary.  I handle all the food along with a friend of mine.  She said she doesn't like the idea, she wants to do a luau with Chinese food catered. I told her I'd rather not have the party if that's the case. AITA? 

Maybe I should have said I've had a health issue and she says she wants me to have a break and not have to work for my own party .  I believe her when she says that but cooking for people makes me happy. "
271,1jurbze,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my boyfriend his parents are too controlling — on his birthday?,"My boyfriend (24M) and I (23F) have been dating for over a year. We’re pretty serious — he stays over at my apartment a few nights a week because his own place isn’t very comfortable. His parents live in another city and have never met me, but I always thought they were fine with us being together.

Lately, though, they’ve been pressuring him to “focus,” saying he’s wasting time with me, that he’s “always at that girl’s house.” It’s been stressing him out, even though he’s an adult and we both work hard.

So for his birthday, I planned a whole day — stuff he loves, just us. I knew if he told his parents he was with me, they’d blow up his phone and guilt him the whole time. I suggested he just... not mention it. Say he was busy with friends, or working — whatever would give him peace.

He agreed — but then told them anyway. As I predicted, they gave him hell. He got upset, then turned it on me. Said I made him lie, that I don’t understand how complicated things are with his family. He went off about how I don’t respect his bond with them, that I “ruined” his birthday by making it all about me.

I told him I was just trying to give him a good day — and honestly, that I think his parents are too involved in his life. He should be allowed to decide where he wants to sleep and who he spends time with.

Now we’re barely speaking, and I feel like the villain for trying to protect a day that was supposed to be about him.

272,1jup15s,Not the A-hole,WIBTAH if I move 1 hour away?,"I 31(F) have an 8yr old boy. My ex (we’ll call him Jack) cheated on me basically our entire relationship & our relationship at the time was very toxic; lots of verbal & emotional abuse. Eventually he kicked me out of the apartment we rented from his parents which was about 5yrs ago now. I have joint custody with Jack. I have my son half of Sunday-Thursday morning and my son goes to his dad’s house/grandparents’ house Thursday night-half of Sunday. On my days, I do all the pick-ups & drop offs to/from school, I do the homework and any therapy appts or other doctors and dentist visits that are needed on a weekly basis or yearly checkups. I inform my sons dad of all appts and sometimes ask him to help or come to support my son for his therapy but sadly he does not make it about 98% of the time. He claims he has to work or needs sleep or he’s not home or forgot about the appt because I didn’t remind him again. In addition, Jack has never participated in 1 school meeting; as my son has an IEP. 

When son goes over Jack's/his grandparents’ house, it's Jack's sister who does the homework on Thursdays and Jacks parents who cloth, bath and feed my son. Currently my son and I live an apartment with 2 cats which is very small. I've been with my current company for 3yrs. Since I do majority of the pick-ups & drop offs to school, I often go into work late & have to leave early so I make it on time for my son. My job graciously lets me WFH as needed to ensure I my 40hrs a week/not blow thru my PTO. This also helps so I am able to take my son to all of his appts (my son struggles with anxiety and a GI problem; hard to go number2) so he often has ""accidents"" which he cannot always control & my son struggles to sleep on his own at night. My son & I always talk about our dream home & I am finally in a position to buy an affordable home and I have an opportunity to grow within my company but the position is at our other location; not mention buying a home close to that location is a cheaper than the current state we live in. My son always asks for a yard to play in and to invite friends over and the whole 9 yards of being in a home VS an apartment. 

Jack has threatened to take me to court saying it's not fair to him or his parents for me to ""take my son away from his family"" even though I proposed 3 different schedules for visitation. 1. The summer we can share every other week (7 days each). 2. When my son goes back to school, my son stays with me Sunday-Friday, Jack or his parents pick my son up from school Friday-stays until Sunday afternoon & school vacations my son can stay with them the whole week (we would meet half way for drop offs so no one has to drive the full hr from each state). 3. My son stays with me all week/every other weekend & they get visitation every other weekend & still have school vacations. None of them liked any of these schedules and just quoted how ""my son needs family"". So, WIBTA if I move 1hr away? Advice from a lawyer would be extremely appreciated!"

Fast forward to today, I went out to my car to go to work and I noticed a some scratches right where he had used his foot to close my door. I’m livid. And I feel like I have the right to be considering I pay over $600 monthly for this car (it was a horrible purchase at a dealership). I am in negative equity. And this car already takes a toll on my mental health being the fact I pay so much. He doesn’t seem to be sorry for what he did and his reply to when I sent him the picture of the scratches he said “The paint doesn’t help the car get to your destination.

274,1juodo8,Everyone Sucks,AITA For disobeying my mom for not getting married?,"I (20F) still live at home with my mom, about a little over a year ago I met my boyfriend and for a couple months now we’ve been talking about moving out together. My mom has honestly always been really supportive and open minded about everything in life, so when I told her I wanted to move out I expected her to be okay with it. Well it was the opposite. She straight up told me no, that I should get married first before moving out. I was really confused because my mom has never been married before so i thought she wasn’t going to care that much. 

I know everyone has different opinions when it comes to moving out first then get married or getting married first then moving in together, i personally want to get married I just want to live with my boyfriend first. Me and my boyfriend said we should get engaged and then move out (he said he’s going to propose in a couple months but won’t tell me exactly when so it can be a surprise). I told my mom this and she got even more angry and said no it’s a dumb idea and I need to get married first or she won’t be talking to me anymore. 

I love and respect my mom so incredibly much but I think i should start living my life for myself. My boyfriend and me planned to get engaged and move out in a couple months and tell my mom like a week before we move out. I feel like if I tell her now it’s going to be really bad and Im not ready to have that conversation with her. But I also feel extremely guilty for hiding this from her.. Should I listen to her and wait to get married or should I do what me and my partner want?

275,1junodb,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to introduce my partner to my industry connections?,"Hello reddit, throw away account. Sorry, I don't have a reddit normally but I wasn't sure where else to go.  
  
Some pretext: I'm a professional writer in the industry with a few larger connections that I've only known for a few years. They saw my work one day and we started talking, I was shocked they liked it. We're not exactly friends, but I have spoken to them and interacted with them a fair bit online. Despite this I'm not exactly what I'd call ""popular"" myself, and not the greatest (or even very good in my opinion) at my craft to begin with. Recently I've been trying to put myself out there more and a few of these connections have been kind enough to promote my work.

Now to the issue, my partner is also a writer with much less experience than me. I love and believe in his work very much, promote it as much as I can and offer to help in whatever ways possible. Promotions, tags, even buying his finished books. I have shared his work in spaces that my connections are able to clearly see and also share it around as well as if they so wish.

Recently him and a close friend of ours have been asking me to ""introduce him"" to these more popular writers. The issue is... There's no natural way to do that and with people I'm not that close to it's very difficult to do so. It's not like we go to events together or hang out in person. I've tried explaining to them that it's not just as easy as putting 2 people in a chat room and saying ""now be friends!"" but I keep being told ""what's the harm!"" and to just make it work. The problem is, even if I do make it work, if they already weren't promoting his work when they saw me actively doing so and were able to join in on the promotion, I don't see them doing it now just because they now know for sure we're close.

Obviously explaining that and refusing to do so made them (both) upset at me and while I understand that it's likely the right thing to do as a partner I also feel like the wrong thing is being focused on. From my perspective, if your work has been shown in spaces where it could have been picked up by these creators but hasn't been, then you should look at why and work on building up your craft more. A lot of success is connections and luck but just as much of it is hard work and growth, and I feel as though my partner thinks the only thing he needs to succeed right now is just to be advertised by the right person.

So AITA for saying no to introducing him to my contacts? And AITA for thinking the way I do?"
276,1junjqs,Not the A-hole,AITA for keeping a relationship with my brothers ex wife when they have two kids together?,"
My brother was married to his wife for 14 years and has two boys together (10 and 12). Their marriage struggled a lot, but they made it last for that long. I became super close with his wife and she was a wonderful wife and mother to him.

I know for a fact my brother cheated on her in the past even though he won’t admit it to me. I’m also 99% sure he left his wife for his current girlfriend although he won’t admit that either.

The divorce has been nasty and restraining orders against him have been in place and everything. They can only speak about the boys.

Recently myself (aunt of the boys) and my mother (grandmother of the boys) made plans to get together with the children and the ex-wife. These plans included staying the night at our house because they live out of town.  My brother found out and blew up, was super pissed off but we were firm that this was not fair for the children and the kids deserve to see everyone get along for their sake. My brother talks shit about their mother often, even infront of them, and we always vowed to not take sides for the sake of the kids.

Of course everything escalated. Our other sibling called me basically telling me we were terrible, how it was selfish to do this to our brother and how dare we pick the ex over family. Basically I was told we were pieces of shit for choosing the children over everything else and neither of my siblings see it as compassion for the kids.

At this the family is split and my brother wants nothing to do with us and neither does my other siblings apparently. 

AITA for this letting my brothers ex wife stay at our house with the kids? Should we not have any sort of relationship with her? In my mind it’s best for the kids to see each side of the family get along and not hate eachother. The divorce has been very traumatizing for both of them. 


ETA: I want to thank everyone who commented on this and gave me reassurance that we did the right thing here and severing ties with my brother isn’t the end of the world. I’m so disappointed at the behavior of him and our other sibling. Unfortunately, they will only associate themselves with people that are on their side 100% of the time and support them to the bitter end. This happens with all of their friendships and everything. However, I’m the person that will tell you when I feel like you may be leaning on the wrong side a bit, and urge people to see the other point of view, and it’s always out of pure love. Regardless, it’s okay if we’re the bad guys here.

Children always come first no matter what and I’ll be their ride or die forever. One day kids will figure it out and I hope when that happens, they know we were always on their side, because they matter the most.

277,1jun7tt,Not the A-hole,"AITA for setting a boundary about not wanting to talk about food, which led to my cousin cutting me off?","I (30s, F) have a young son, Asher, who has significant challenges with food due to autism. His eating habits aren’t just “picky”—they’re tied to how he processes the world. It’s something we’ve been working through with professionals, and it causes me a lot of stress and anxiety. I cry over it multiple times a week.

My cousin Kelsey and I were close, but over time, our conversations around food became really triggering. She would often send photos of her child eating healthy meals, make comments about how certain foods are “gross” or “bad” (foods Asher eats, like Goldfish), and send me suggestions or tips that—while maybe well-intentioned—came across as passive advice that I didn’t ask for. One time Asher was eating Goldfish and she casually mentioned she read they’re a leading cause of cavities. Stuff like that adds up when you’re already emotionally overwhelmed.

After talking to my therapist, I decided to set a boundary. I messaged her to say that food is a hard subject for me, and I’d prefer not to talk about it anymore. I made it clear it wasn’t about her—it was about my own anxiety and what I’m going through with Asher. I even said I was embarrassed to admit how hard it’s been, and I just wanted to avoid the topic to protect my mental health.

She didn’t take it well. She said maybe they just “shouldn’t come around anymore,” and when I tried to clarify that I wasn’t blaming her and that I valued our relationship, she doubled down and said she was distancing herself. I stayed calm, explained again that I wasn’t accusing her of anything, and that this boundary was about me—not her. But she cut things off completely.

I honestly didn’t expect this reaction. I wasn’t rude. I wasn’t attacking her. I set a personal boundary and was shut out over it.

I’ve been blocked for months. 

So… AITA for setting a clear boundary about not wanting to talk about food—even if it made her uncomfortable?"
278,1jun3s3,Not the A-hole,AITA for being selfish,"I(f18) I am a senior in high school and I currently live with my parents. Recently, my step- mom has flipped a switch on me. She has been asking for me to help pay more things, help out around the house ect.( which is completely understandable if I wasn’t so busy) I work a job(with 20 hours a week) and I’m currently salutatorian of my class and I volunteer 2 days out of the week for another future job. I hardly am home and when I am , I am working on homework or club stuff. 
Anytime I try to explain it or express my feelings about her treating me unfairly, I get a chat gpt generated response. Since my sophomore year, I have been financially independent aside from basic necessities like bills and food(but ebt). She hasn’t helped with any school stuff, school supplies or club funds to help me get through the year. and when they offered me a class ring, she spent all of the income tax money on herself and her friends before finally deciding to save a little bit after my dad convinced her and then asked everybody else around her for money to help buy the stuff. (which I found out was supposed to be my graduation money from these people that she just didn’t wanna pay or help with..) I have to put myself through college and other things.
She expects me to pay these things even though I get no help from her financially.
(Such as prom which was a hard no from her) 
So AITA for saying no and choosing myself. "
279,1jun1y1,Not enough info,WIBTA if I ask an acquaintance if they are insecure over something?,"I (F30) recently made a new friend/acquaintance (F late 20s) through a recreational activity where we have loads of mutual friends/acquaintances. I enjoy their company/conversation and would like to get to know them better. 

We are both prone to oversharing (I'm very much neurodivergent, the jury is out on her but it would not surprise me) and she has said some things that make me think she's insecure/sad about the (lack of?) attention she gets from men. 

WIBTA if I asked her about it? Personally,  I don't really mind these kind of armour-piercing questions and I think it helps build connection with people and shows care/concern,  but I realise that perhaps not everyone feels the same. 

Not sure if relevant,  but I'm gay - so I think there is a possibility that I don't see this line of questioning as AH-ish because I don't care about male romantic attention,  if that makes sense? 


EDIT:
Thanks everyone for your responses! You guys are right,  this would be an AH move on my part. Thanks for helping me to see that!  "
280,1jumxr7,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to train my in-laws' dog?,"I (43M) am a dog trainer and mainly work with reactive/aggressive dogs. My SIL (39F) and BIL (46M) have two Bichons, who are both poorly trained and dog-aggressive. A few months ago, SIL and BIL got a Presa Canario puppy, Mia.

When I first heard this, I was horrified, as Presas are **not** beginner dogs—they are extremely powerful with a high prey drive, and often dog- and human-aggressive. One of my dogs is a Presa cross, and her training is basically a full time job in itself. So I offered to help train Mia—mainly because they have two young kids (6F and 11F)—but they declined.

Mia is now 6 months old and dog-aggressive (including toward the Bichons), completely untrained, too strong to be kept under control on leash, and has started snapping at the kids. SIL asked me to train her, so I took a couple of weeks off work to help out.

Mia's very smart and we quickly built a great rapport, but BIL and SIL were just not engaged with the process. BIL regularly argued with me about my methods, while SIL laughed off safety concerns I raised about all three dogs. They both found it difficult to stop yelling at Mia, and reacted badly when I told them not to use choke chains or prong collars with her. I'm pretty used to this kind of thing, since dog training is fundamentally about human training, but it still got on my nerves since I was effectively working for free.

After a week of training, they decided it would be cool to leave the dogs alone with the kids and a 14-year-old babysitter. I had repeatedly told them never to leave kids unsupervised around *any* of their dogs due to the bite risk, so when I found out I was pissed.

I asked if they had thought about what would happen if someone got bitten, and SIL said that's what the training was for. I asked, 'What training, the training neither of you can be bothered with?' and BIL said they'd hired me specifically so they could get a break from it. I said they hadn't hired me, I was doing it for free because I was scared for their kids and dogs, and BIL replied that if my training had done so little his kids were still in danger then clearly I was a shit trainer. I said that's fine, I won't train her then, and began to leave. BIL said I was being fucking ridiculous, so I said no, what's fucking ridiculous is that they would bring a literal fighting dog into their house when they can't even housetrain the dogs they had. I left, and didn't do any more training with Mia.

SIL has since reached out to ask me to keep training Mia, even offering to pay. I explained I didn't want to be held responsible if they didn't fully commit to the training and someone got hurt. However, I'm starting to feel like an asshole, because I don't want the kids or dogs to get hurt, and I don't want Mia to be put down if she bites someone. My partner (44M) also really wants me to go back, as he's worried about his nieces and doesn't want his sister and partner arguing. AITA?"
281,1jumvic,Not the A-hole,AITA for having a relationship with my aunt (mom’s sister) even though they hate each other?,"My mom and my aunt haven’t had contact since my grandmother died in 2017. Even as children, they never really got along and it worsened over time. My aunt always babysat me, bought me things, etc. but my mother and aunt would fight nearly everyday. As early as i can remember they fought frequently, usually in front of me. 

A few years ago i reconnected with my aunt after a bit of no contact (to please my mother). I have maintained a relationship with my aunt over the past few years without telling my mother. She found out today that i had been speaking to my aunt. I went to a lot of therapy to figure out how to maneuver these relationships and could never figure it out. My dad’s brother and wife also have issues with my mother so we have limited contact with them as well. I always thought it was widely inappropriate to expose a child/non involved party to these adult issues, but it has been my life for the last 30 years. 

I suspect my mother to be a narcissist, have bipolar, or borderline personality disorder. She’s never been officially diagnosed, but she has multiple symptoms/characteristics that align with those diagnoses. This makes it nearly impossible to reason with her. I’m feeling conflicted because my daughter loves her grandparents and i have brothers i want to keep a relationship with. I feel guilty for not telling my mother but how was i supposed to tell her? 

She has hit me a couple of times before when we fought, called the cops on me, etc. she’s unpredictable and i have zero interest in entertaining her bs anymore. I’ve tried to go no contact before but she still caused issues. I don’t know how to handle this and i feel like I’m the asshole"
282,1jum0l3,Not the A-hole,AITA for snapping at a girl for breaking my car mirror while checking her makeup?,"

AITA for snapping at a girl for breaking my car mirror while checking her makeup?

So I (24M) was helping my girlfriend (23F) host a party for her friend, who's also a photographer. It was part of a barter arrangement my girlfriend throws the party, and the photographer gives her a free photoshoot.

I had just gotten my car back from repairs after it had been rear-ended and sat out of commission for over six months. Naturally, I parked it far away from the party to keep it safe.

Early into the party, the photographer had a meltdown because she thought 400 balloons weren’t enough for the jumping castle. She pulled out another 200 and expected us to blow those up too while she was crying about it. My girlfriend (who was also trying to enjoy the party) brought her a drink and tried to calm her down. The rest of us were busting our asses getting everything set up.

The photographer ended up going over to the spot where I parked my car and stayed there for a while. At some point, I got asked to go buy more ice, and when I got to my car, I noticed the side mirror had been folded awkwardly forward and was half hanging out of its housing. I managed to pop it back in place and drove off, thinking it was just a minor thing.

On the way out, I asked my girlfriend if she knew what happened. She casually told me that the photographer used my side mirror to check her makeup. That annoyed me because 1) who uses someone else's car mirror like that, and 2) it’s a fragile, recently repaired car.

After I got the ice, I tested the mirror controls and found they no longer worked properly, the mirror was stuck and wouldn’t fold back in electronically. I was pissed. When I got back to the party, I vented and made a (probably sarcastic) comment while handing someone the ice, like, “Hope her makeup looks amazing, because she broke my mirror.”

This sparked some drama. The photographer came running up, saying she “just twisted it a little” and that she could fix it if I had only said something. I was already frustrated and told her, “It’s fine, I’ll fix it,” and walked away. She kept following me, but I honestly stopped listening.

Later, when I went to leave, I was cornered by three of her family members demanding to know what she did to my car because she was crying again. They wanted me to leave the car with them so they could fix it. I politely declined and made an excuse. I didn’t trust anyone else with the car after the long repairs.

Later that night, I took the door panel off to investigate and found she had somehow sheared straight through the wiring harness with a sharp metal edge while twisting the mirror. That’s how rough she was.

I texted her the next day to say I was sorry for being upset, and told her the mirror was fixed and she didn’t need to worry. She hasn’t replied in 3 days, and it looks like she’s ghosting both me and my girlfriend and now might not even follow through with the photo shoot.

So... AITA for calling her out and being visibly annoyed when she broke my car mirror?


"
283,1julya6,Not enough info,AITA for refusing to forgive an old friend?,"TL;DR: A friend of mine turned nasty in her last relationship, and wants to be friends again now that they have broken up. 

For context, my (20F) old friend (also 20F, let’s call her Sophie) was no hassle whatsoever about a year ago. She then got into a relationship with someone I know and all was fine at first until her only topic of conversation was about her boyfriend. I could’ve put up with that, but after a couple of months she started to cut off myself/my partner (i.e. wouldn’t reply to messages, stopped initiating plans, etc.).

There have been many instances in the past of red flags in her behavior that had been building up for some time, but these were the two that I just couldn’t see past.

The first breaking point came when myself, my partner, Sophie, her boyfriend & some other friends of ours went on a trip together - Sophie was miserable, argumentative and generally unpleasant to be around the entire time. She wound up getting so annoyed at her partner for something super trivial that she insisted they leave early and didn’t even say goodbye. After that, she didn’t speak to any of us and when she did, it was almost always small talk. 

The second breaking point came when I invited her to my birthday in January (my birthday is June 12th). She cancelled a few days prior and said that ‘it wasn’t worth coming for just one night’ (she lives around 2 hours away and has never had an issue with travelling in the past) - we didn’t speak for a while after that, but she kept in contact with my partner. 

Recently, she and her boyfriend broke up, and her immediate response was to text my partner about it rather than me. Since then, she’s been making the effort to visit, and is actively trying to get back into the friendship group. She has apologised to my partner, but not to me or the rest of our friends who have also been affected by her behaviour. We’ve spoken, but it’s primarily small-talk and there’s a sense of awkwardness every time we interact. 

I don’t feel in a position to be friends with her like I once was, but she is clearly pushing to be. AITA for resisting?"
284,1jukp5e,Asshole,AITA for kicking my bf out of a wedding we were invited to?,"Me (24F) and my bf (26M) were invited to a friends wedding. To start off, my bf constantly has injuries on himself. His hands always have scratches, he always has some sort of cut or bruise somewhere on him, I dont think I have ever seen him without any sort of injury or blemish on his body. The worst has always been his hands, he does carpentry, mechanical things, spends a lot of time in the woods, and is always working on or getting into some crap that puts scratches and cuts all over his hands. 

When I told him there was a wedding I mentioned I did not want to be there with him if his hands were a mess. He tried to tell me that it isnt a big deal, that his hands dont look dirty and that cuts are different from dirt. I told him all the things he does that cut his hands are unnessesary and he doesn't need to do any of it. He tried to tell me that he works on projects because they are his hobbies, and also a way for him to pay his parents back for living with them since they dont charge rent. I told him he has a high paying job, just pay rent like a normal person. He said it isnt about the money, he does things for people to show he appreciates them. And that he would do this for me because he appreciates me. 

4 weeks pass, for the first time the skin on his hands are clear. He still has some scratches on his body from climbing trees birdwatching, but at least he wore gloves so his hands would be fine. 

Night of the wedding comes, he wants to drive me but we have to take seperate cars because of my work. I stand outside to wait for him, and the first thing I notice is that his hands have scratches on them again. I was pissed. I told him to leave. He tried telling me he had to fix his grandmas car because she cant afford a mechanic. I screamed that he should just pay for a mechanic like a normal person. He left, and called me trying to say hes sorry. I told him I dont want to deal with this anymore, either he gives up all his things that HURT him, or I leave. He told me he wont give up his hobbies or to not try his best to help people. Which, I dont get why he even sees it that way. He can help by just giving the money or something. He is always doing crap for his family and has done the same for me (built furniture, fixed my car, did some sort of structural repair on my mothers porch, etc etc etc) but it gets old. I like that he does things, I just dont want to date someone that doesnt care about their appearance, and would rather do literally everything themselves rather than just pay. It isnt fair that he gets to do what he wants but if I ask for something simple it is too much for him. How much is it to ask someone to just take care of themselves and behave like a normal adult? 

Edit: I have been thinking things over. I am wrong. I dont want to make excuses, but I was stressed from the wedding, and my bf has had some scary moments when he injured himself (broke his leg on an atv, broke his tooth falling in the woods, has ripped off fingernails and toenails, treats himself with antibiotics for livestock, etc). Ive been with him for 7 years, I am constantly worried for his safety and health. It came out in the worst of ways. I think classism may also pay a part, my family are white collar and talk down any repairman or blue collar workers. Seeing someone do it for fun is still alien to me, but I do appreciate what he does and how hard he works. I am lucky, be means the absolute best, just bumbling and wreckless. I am going to call now and apologize for everything. "
285,1jukipp,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling our moms they can’t join our vacation?,"My fiancé and I are getting married in August. We are in the thick of wedding planning and stressed AF. 

He travels for work and has acquired 3 free nights at any Hilton property. We booked the Waldorf Astoria in Cabo. Because he is a diamond member, we were upgraded to a massive 2 bedroom villa (over 2500 sq feet). All for free.

My dad is a FA and so we get very cheap flights  there. Basically, the entire vacation will only cost us about $500.

Anyway, both of our moms have asked to join. They are 60 and 70, one divorced, one widowed. We are very close with both of them and like each other’s moms well enough. But ALL THEY DO is talk about wedding planning, and them joining would obviously change the dynamic of the trip. We want to be able to have sex, swim naked, do whatever we want, and it’ll be different with our moms there. 

Anyway, I know I shouldn’t feel bad, but I do. I feel like we are getting this opportunity of a lifetime that they’ve never had and that we owe it to them to allow them to join. I also think having them there could be fun, in a different way. They’d have their own bedroom and could do their own thing. But my fiancé really doesn’t want them joining and doesn’t want to hear about wedding stuff all vacation. 

Our moms have brought up a few times how they are so jealous and we are so lucky and they wish they could join, and we sorta just laugh it off. But I feel so guilty, clearly since I’m asking here. 

Very curious to hear other’s thoughts. Are my fiancé and I assholes for saying no?

Update: this is NOT our honeymoon. We are going to Cabo this week. It’s just a random vacation to use up free Hilton nights that will be expiring soon. We will still have a proper honeymoon after our wedding. "
286,1jukb9h,Asshole,AITA For wanting my license?,"I, 16,almost 17,year old female have been trying to find time to get my license for over a year. I texted my mother to see if we could get it after my school day. She responded she was working so I replied asking if my grandmother could take me there. She blew up on my and said I needed to be more responsible, I explained to my mother how responsible I was and how I wanted my license to be even more responsible. This only made her more upset. So I responded how unfair it is to me that when I try to be more responsible like she says she shuts me down. Am I the Asshole for wanting my license? 
(Edit: I'd like to add that she had messaged me from her job first and I had offered the idea of my grandmother taking me so she wouldn't have to worry about it. Mind, my grandmother is her mother that she thinks is trying to use me) "
287,1jukac3,Not the A-hole,AITA for honking at a dude looking at his phone while driving?,"This morning I was driving to work at about 5AM. I'm on a two lane road, the car in front of me is swerving a  lot, driving 20 km/h under the limit. I stay behind him until I find a safe window to overtake and see this dude is clearly holding his phone in front of him. I give a short tap of the horn and pass him. Suddenly he's not driving slow and swerving anymore but staying right behind me. Not really tailgating but just on my ass untill we reach the traffic lights. He pull up besides me and rolls his window down. He politely tells me to mind my own mother\*\*\*\*ing business it's 5 in the \*\*\*\*ing morning there's no \*\*\*\*ing traffic anyway (which was true, I only saw a handfull of cars on that \~15km road).

So I politely tell him it's illegal, dangerous and downright \*\*\*\*ing stupid to play with your \*\*\*\*ing phone while driving a car. The light turns green, he flips me the bird and we both continue on our merry way.

I've talked to some people about it. Most seemed to agree yeah honk at texting drivers, but others were more nuanced. I didn't know what the guy was dealing with, he probably some personal shit to deal with and there barely was any traffic to begin with. Others said I could have escalted an already dangerous situation because you never know what deranged lunatics you might be pissing off.

So okay he might have been having some personal issues, but he clearly wasn't in a rush otherwise he wouldn't be driving 20 under the limit on an otherwise mostly empty road.

I'm probably overthinking this, but am I the asshole?"
288,1jujz7h,Not the A-hole,AITAH for telling my grandma to find someone else to cry to?,"It’s a long story but I’ll make it short. My grandma 63F has been with Jeff 56M on and off for the last 10 years. It has always been my problem as she always comes running to me and my sister to cry about how bad Jeff is to her. Then the next day she will tell us how much Jeff has done for and he’s the best man she’s been with. We’ve each opened our house for her a few times and she would go back after a couple months. So we told her we won’t continue moving our house around because at this point it seems like she likes being a victim at the hands of Jeff. Because she had a support system to leave and also she never calls the cops or will cover for him when someone else does. 

Well these past 6 months we thought it was the real deal because Jeff and grandma were actually going to divorce court. Last week I waited 2 and half hours out the courthouse in another city to wait for my grandma to be done with divorce court. She comes out and gives me a bullshit excuse on why she HAS to leave with Jeff to figure things out for the divorce. She told me go shared and go home.  I told her wow how incredibly selfish of her to have me wait this long just to leave with that monster. She told me she has no choice because they have to take care of something. Ok whatever I leave. 

She called me five days after the hearing and told me she’s living with Jeff again. She started to tell me how special he is to her and she just can’t bring herself to leave. I said okay that fine but just so you know I won’t be your shoulder to cry on anymore. I said idc if Jeff’s good to you today or bad to you I don’t want to hear the words Jeff come from her mouth ever again to me. I said honestly the last 10 years 90% of our conversation either revolved around her or Jeff and I’m so sick of it. I said maybe if she actually pretended to even care about me and my sisters life we might be a little more giving but she literally doesn’t care. She only listens to what we have to say so she can bring it back to JEFF or bring it back to what a hot blonde she was  and had such a plump butt. Like my god I’m actually so sick of hearing that same sentence over over again from her. 

Anyways she told me just neeeds someone to vent to and that’s why she talks to us about it. I told her well she better find someone else because if she talks to me and my sister about Jeff we are hanging up immediately. If we are out to eat and she says Jeff’s name we will get up immediately and leave her there. I told her she needs to practice not being so self centered because she has absolutely drained me and my little sisters the past 10 years cuz all we want is a good relationship with her and it’s hard when she is so self centered and doesn’t even remember our birthday.  Only hers and Jeff’s. Shit not even my mom’s birthday (her daughter). AMITA for being this hard with my grandma? 

TLDR: my grandma goes back and forth with her abusive husband and drags me and my sister into it. We told her we won’t be her shoulder to cry on anymore because it’s draining both of us. At this point it seems like she likes being a victim at the hands of him. "
289,1jujs7f,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my parents that they don’t care?,"Hi, 
My (21M) parents have helped both of my siblings (27F) and (21M) financially quite a few times in our adulthoods, co-signing for loans, cars and houses but whenever I have needed help I.e making one car payment, or recently needing a co-signer to go back to school, my parents out right said no without even talking it over or seeing if it was possible. I know they have bills as well but when I was 18 I got a $15000 loan for them so they could build a garage and paid it all down on my own besides $1000 of it. And parents just got a brand new vehicle after they said they wouldn’t/couldn’t co-sign for me… So I told them that if they can’t see how all of that has made it hard for me to be around them for a bit and they just simply said I’m overreacting… TIA "
290,1jujq38,Not the A-hole,AITA for not always giving 100% at the gym?,"My husband (33M) and I (30F) have been going to the gym three times a week since 2023, after doing home workouts during COVID. Our routine involves cardio followed by either an arm or leg workout. My husband prefers to do cardio first, but I find it tiring and think it impacts my weightlifting performance.
To keep cardio interesting, I switch between the bike, elliptical, rowing machine, and treadmill and watch something on my phone. However, my husband  believes I'm not putting in enough effort when I choose anything other than the treadmill, which will lead to him getting in a bad mood. Recently, I opted for the elliptical while recovering from a cold and dealing with a persistent headache. I also received disappointing job news just before heading to the gym yesterday. So, boring treadmill running wasn't what I wanted to do.
The cardio workouts aren't mear 5-10 minute warm-ups but 30 minute sessions, and afterward, I struggle to push through my weightlifting sets effectively. Nonetheless, I've been gradually increasing my weights and focus on lower reps to conserve energy for my next sets while not going into full failure.
While I understand I should be working out for myself,  our regimen is based on what my husband wants and doesn't really consider what I want to work on.
I take one rest day a week, while on the other three days, I either run for 30 minutes outdoors (which he thinks isn't long enough), go for an hour-long walk, or do abs/yoga at home.
Our gym sessions typically take place from 6 PM to 8:45 PM on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.

Before anyone asks, we've been married nearly 10 years. I've expressed this all before multiple times (and very recently). We also do two arm and one leg workout each week. He would rather do an extra gym day than me taking an arm day to do my own thing. Neither of us are overweight (he was before I met him and I'm sure that's why he's overly obsessed about working out).

So, an I the asshole for not doing the treadmill every gym session and not going to failure during every set?

Edit:
Thank you all for the support and encouraging words and insight. It means a lot and appreciate the different view points.

Many people have asked if he's like this in other areas. And yes he can be but the point of this post was specifically with the gym.
That being said... I can wear what I want, hangout with my friends, play games, read books, all that stuff with no issues.
When it comes to food it's complicated. Meal wise, fast food he'll give me shit for and snacking sometimes. He is a BIG snacker, like will go to the store and get three or more bags full of snacks. Always looking for new things to try. So, our house is filled with pretzels, chips, candy, etc. He even has his own snack cart on his side of the couch (think the trolley from Harry Potter). I'll have some of these snacks because they will go bad otherwise, and there will be time (especially on rest days) he'll make an off handed comment about eating the snacks. His justification for him to eat it all is that he goes on a 5 mile run every day or a 3 mile run with his gym workout. I've never said he needs to cut back or anything. 
If I truly want something, I will have it even if it puts him in a bad mood."
291,1jujfej,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving home despite my mother and her partner’s finances?,"I (17F) and my mother moved into her boyfriend’s house about two years ago. They seem like a relatively stable couple, beside the fact that she seems to control him and not let him have a voice for himself unless it aligns perfectly with her points of view. 

Over the past year, i have been kicked out of the house on multiple occasions. the first because i was struggling with mental health that she didn’t want to deal with, the second because i reported her for the former, and the third because i spoke to my college counsellor to address concerns about her behaviour after she was embarrassed and refused to be seen as my mother while i had to use a walking cane for a while. she then went with the story that i reported her and her boyfriend for “abuse”. all three times i have been painted as the abuser in the situation despite her constant physical and emotional abandonment. It is worth mentioning that she has also tried siphoning my PIP money out of me to have a car that she didn’t have to pay for.

I recently applied for universal credit, (i live in the UK) specifically the working capability element as i cannot work due to my disability. I refused to ask her for help with my application and after being told i was fully eligible by DWP, she refused to listen and complained that they would lose the house if i went through with the application. (Note: The claim is ongoing, and I am checking with DWP that there are no mistakes with the claim to make sure i’m fully eligible without affecting others. I have so far been told that I will only cause my mother to lose her child benefit which will be passed onto me) Because of this, she threw me out of the house once and for all, texting me that same day “you’re now homeless, go deal with it.” Later that day after I had a phone call with an emergency housing agency, she agreed to let me come home despite the circumstances. I went home for the night, but declared the next day that I would be moving into supported accommodation as per the agency’s suggestion. She is currently begging me to stay as she will lose even more of her benefits with me not living at home (child benefit, elements of housing benefit, etc). 

I refuse to let her keep me under her roof any longer while I don’t know when my next night sleeping in a hotel for god knows how long is. 

So, AITA for refusing to take her bs any longer? "
292,1juj7um,Asshole,AITA for setting strict standards or boundaries on my boyfriend regarding drinking,"My boyfriend and I are both students and both do drink. Before I met him, he drank pretty much everyday but only until he met me he stopped drinking so much because he wanted to be better for me. Only until recently, he started drinking a lot more now where his only hangouts with friends are just drinking, nothing else, just drinking. He even just has a bottle or two just at home for the sake of drinking. I have explained my feelings towards alcoholism and how I won’t tolerate and want to be with someone who drinks a lot because it makes me very uncomfortable due to trauma. 
I told him again yesterday that him getting drunk and drinking a lot more now is really pushing me to the edge where I said if he continues to drink this much I will not be with him, only for him to just be confused and say it’s unfair because how can I drink but he can’t, even though I have like 2 pints once a week (estimate, sometimes just nothing). Sometimes I just go out with my friends and drink when he does and then he gets worried when I do and brings that up although it doesn’t even happen frequently, I just do it sometimes because he is out doing that yet I’m not with him.
I have also told him I’d be cool with us drinking together but he doesn’t even do that with me, it’s just his friends because he’s said “You said you don’t like me drinking so” although I have said I do drink sometimes and I’d be willing to do that with him if you invited me but he never does.

I can’t tell if I’m in the wrong for appearing restrictive, in his words, for telling him I won’t be with him if he continues to drink so much because I don’t want to be that person that enforces these standards or boundaries but it really does make me uncomfortable.

293,1juijhg,Asshole,AITA For bringing drama into my girlfriends life,"I (26m) have a girlfriend (23f), we met in uni and have a few mutual friends that we sometimes bump into. One of our mutual ""friends"" if I can even call him that... let's call this friend James. James is a very hot and cold boy, he's also gay (not that that matters I'm just trying to paint a picture of him).

Before I got in a relationship with my girlfriend, I knew James anyway, we had a few nights out etc etc and he's always been very hot and cold with me. Sometimes in my uni class he would be lovely and ask me questions. But other times on nights out he would be mean. Once he said ""Ow look there the fucking walking red flag"" and I didn't even do anything that night?! 

When I bumped into him at a festival he didn't really seem to want to talk to me and so I made conversation with his friends instead. Just various things like this. 

At the start of my relationship, when me and my girlfriend weren't really exclusive yet. He asked me about my girlfriend while I bumped into him at a night club, ""How is she?"" And I said ""She's nothing at the minute, she said she isn't ready for a relationship and blocked me, but I thought I did everything right?""

James replies, ""honestly, she looks cool and all but there's not much more to her honestly.""

Fast forward nearly a year and me and my girlfriend eventually did work out, and I let this slip out when James came up in conversation. My girlfriend told her best friend, her best friend messaged James, James posted about it all over his private story, and now people are messaging my girlfriend telling her that ""I'm wrong, there's no way"" . . . 

None of those people where there? So now my girlfriend is struggling who to believe and is stressed out because she has been caught in drama, drama that I never meant to cause. My girlfriend and James aren't even that close anyway, they bump into eachother every few months at a bar... Last time that she saw him he was really cold with her and didn't really seem to want to talk to her anyway. 

I'm just so confused and feel bad for my girlfriend for having drama on her plate. But at the same time I AM NOT A LIAR and will defend myself until the end. It's just her bestfriend now thinks I am."
294,1juieyk,No A-holes here,AITA? Tripp to poland with school,"Each year the 10th grade goes to Poland to see the terrible things and leftover stuff from the Jews (heard suitcases shoes and dead remains) from ww2 and u have to decide if u wanna go in 8th grade (which i am in) and i told my mom i did not wanna go.

 She asked why and i said (translated from norwegian) ""i am just not interested"" and ""i under stand why it is important but im just not committed (i know it does not make sense but i fogor the word and dont wanna think + Google says this) enough to wanna go"" and my mom asked why which made me annoyed beacuse i just said why i did not

 then she asked me ""do you just not care at all?! (Not loudly but she sounded a anoyed) And i did answer i did care and i can see why other people like and are interested in the topic but this just aint the thing i am interested in (like... At all) and she knows that.

 I kept saying things that are similar to what i told u guys but in a different ways and more reason (she would Listen to i mean)and she (maybey what i say is a little (not that much) bit changed cus i dont really remember what she said as i forget these kinda things REALLY easily but its of the same essence) ""why do u not care""

 (im here thinking i do (and i told her that i care but imcare but im just not interested which is true), all u do is sitt in ur room and watch videos (its anime actually 🤓) and play video games (which is true but i do good in school) all day""

 (as the story goes on i could hear her getting more anoyed while i was just sitting there calmly explaining why i dont wanna) and after 3-4 minutes back and forth she said ""thats it, go to ur room. I do t even wanna se u anymore at all"".

 I am happy she said i could go away from her being anoyed but i do still think she over reacted just a bit though

Note: i did say ""why do you even wanna force me"" (which it did sound like when she talked and in the way her voice sounded) and se replied ""im not trying to force you"". This was fairly early on but i forgot it and i dont wanna find a place to putt this info in right now

And now im thinking im justified and think im not the bad one (neither is she but i am really anoyed at her), i think she over reacted and was to emotional when trying to convince me (which she had no way of doing by the way). 

Note two (prob not relevant):i am not a fan of belieing with strangers and this would likley invole it pluss a VERY long busstrip (which is not why)

Ps: we are on normal terms (around an hour later) right now but i feel like she could be anoyed (based on previous experiences) 

Now im righting this Sinse right after this and im wondering. AITA?"
295,1jui8d2,Not enough info,AITA for refusing to pay my roommate for a new stove?,"I lived the past summer in a house with a group of male friends. One night, I went to make a frozen pizza but I was a little bit high so instead of hitting bake on the oven, I hit broil. Turns out, one of my roommates thought the broiler was a storage shelf and had been storing all the wooden cutting boards in the broiler.

I did not check the broiler before starting the oven, because I didn’t mean to hit broil and I didn’t expect there to be wooden cutting boards in the oven.

Fast forward a few minutes, there is a fire in the oven and massive amounts of smoke filling the house. We put it out with an extinguisher but the oven was ruined. The landlord ended up having to get a new oven put in. 

Things went back to normal and I moved out at the end of the summer to go back to college, thinking nothing of the oven incident. My buddies stayed living there and replaced me with another roommate who lived in town. 

However, now the original lease is up and the landlord wants us to pay for the oven replacement. The guy who put the wooden cutting boards in the broiler hit me up asking me to pay for half since it was “both of our fault.” I told him I wasn’t going to pay because if he didn’t put wood in the oven, it would have been fine. He says I have a responsibility to check the oven/broiler before starting it. 

So what do you think? AITA for refusing to pay half? Am I somewhat at fault and should pay half? What say you good people of Reddit?


EDIT: okay friends, I have to tap out. I tried to respond to as many comments as possible. Overall this has been fun! Here are my takeaways:

-I’m going to pay for half. I can definitely see the arguments for 50/50 blame and overall the friendship is most important to me. It’s worth it and probably the right thing to do. Ultimately, I should have checked the oven and will do so going forward. Thanks to everyone who laid this out in kind and constructive manner!

-Most convincing argument in the comments: “Don’t be a scrub, pay half.”  They got me, I can’t argue with that!

-It seems that storing things in the oven is WAY more common than I thought. Check your ovens before using them people! Never know what might be in there.

-Lots of good points about the landlord in all this. Before I pay, I’m going to team up with my buddy and see if we can’t both avoid paying. Thank you!

-Some of you guys really think weed is like PCP or something. The amount of comments stating I was out of my mind trying to operate “adult equipment” was shocking. I smoked one joint between three people. I’ve made hundreds of frozen pizzas under similar circumstances and never had a single incident because there was no wood secretly stored in the oven ;)

-This was more about me not thinking that checking was necessary. I have accidentally pressed the wrong button before sober, and probably will again. I wouldn’t have checked even if I was sober. Congrats to all the people who have never made an appliance mistake though lol. 

-I am still not convinced by the people who say I should pay 100%. The guy who stored literal wood in an oven without telling any one, has no blame here? I really have no reasonable expectation that it’s okay to use my broiler, or that there won’t be wood in the oven? It feels like a few people are projecting their own questionable oven storage habits onto this. 

-To the few people who came in super hot/aggressive, being rude and telling me to “grow the fuck up” or that I’m a bad person for even considering I might be in the right here… just wow. You guys could use some self-reflection. I’m literally here becaus I’m self-reflecting and asking for unbiased opinions.

Maybe it’s time to time to get off your high horses and look in the mirror. You guys are so judgmental and condescending to a person you don’t know at all. Most times these people didn’t even have the facts right but felt comfortable coming in guns blazing.

None of this is that serious. 

We’re all human here, we all make mistakes. For your sake, I hope the people in your life don’t treat you with the same ill-informed judgement and condescending attitude that you did to me. 

-Thanks again everyone! I hope we all enjoyed a good old fashioned AITA. I know I did :)"
296,1jui0wo,Not the A-hole,AITA for not closing the stall door when peeing?,"I went to the restroom at work earlier and both urinals were marked out of order so I had to go in one of the stalls. I didn't think anything of it and just went in to pee. Someone else came into the restroom and yelled that I should ""close the damn door next time"" as they walked to the next stall. Standing in a stall even with the door open gives more privacy than the tiny dividers between the actual urinals. I guess I can see where if there's a door it should be used but it's not like I was pulling my pants down.
So AITA for not closing the stall door?"
297,1juhvsh,Not the A-hole,AITA for taking a brother/fatherly role over his father,"So I’m a camp counselor in the summer, this is a sleep away two week session. When I was a counselor there was this one boy that was getting bullied for “boy things” one night. We talked and bonded and I reinsured him about things that happened that night and I brought my past experience with more or less the same issue. This happened like 2 years ago, and ever since then he’s been attached to me and ask me question ever so often about things. He comes from a somewhat disfunctional family with only a mother to my knowledge. He’s the oldest of three brothers. Let me say this before I get farther in this, his mother knows we talked about what I mentioned above and thanked me for it. Everytime we talked in the back of my mind is does he have a father he can talk to before I give me advice? At this point we talk to the point of me basically calling him my little cousin. I help him out the majority of the time with questions he may have but I still feel like I’m intruding and taking over a role that shouldn’t be for me. I had an extra baseball ticket to a game my buddy couldn’t go to so I asked him “has he ever been to a baseball game” and he said no. So I said to give me his mother’s number and we chatted a bit and i asked her if it was alright if i took him, she agreed and that’s that. It is weird though? Am I stepping over a familial line? Am I getting to close to him as a non family member? I’m not sure if I should ask the mother about whether or not I’m getting too close. 

Please let me know if this is to weird or I’m crossing a line where I shouldn’t be. "
298,1juhpb3,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I tell my friend to stop talking about my skin tone?,"I live in Germany and we go to school here. Well obviously most people here are German.

My mother is German and my father is egyptian.

My mother has really pale skin, like the whitest it gets and my father has pretty brown skin. I turned out very light and that as the only one of my siblings. Not as light as my mom, but similair.

So my friend has darker skin than most in our class. There's a boy with a similair shade and a boy with darker skin than her, but that's all.

And the thing is she keeps bringing my skin colour up, A LOT. Like it literally feels like everyday. She just keeps talking about my skin tone abd how light it is and that it looks white. And she keeps comparing me with randome German girls in our class and says I have the same skin (which isn't true).

Look, I wouldn't have a problen if we'd talk about it every once in a while, but almost everyday is too much for me.

I think about asking her if we could not talk about it, because it feels weird and makes me feel really uncomfortable.

But yk, there are also some racist boys in our class who made racist comments about her skin colour and all (they were racist to me too, so they don't just don't like her). Like, maybe she just needs to talk about this stuff and all.

I think I might be the asshole, because as a friend she should be able to talk to me about everything amd I really want her to be able to do that.
So I asked my parents what they think too and my mother thought that maybe she just needs to talk about this with someone and that I'm a little sensitive. So that's why I wonder if I might be an asshole if I ask her to stop talking about my skin colour and I also now that skin colour is a sensitive topic for her. She has in the past already said, that I just hate being German, so I fear this conservation could might cause trouble between us.

So, reddit, WIBTA if I ask her not to bring up my skin colour again?

Thank you already!


Edit: So guy, thanks to you all! I'll defenetifly talk to her abd ask her why she keeps bringing it up and if she maybe wabts to talk to me, rather than just telling her to stop. Thanks for all the advice, I really appreciate it!"
299,1juhkoh,Asshole,AITA for locking my cat in my room?,"Hey guys, so l (19F) have two roommates (20F and 19F). This one roommate, who we'll call Anna, recently got a kitten. I've had my cat since October, he's a 3 year old male, has all of his shots and has been neutered. He used to be a stray cat but ever since I took him in he has just had the most perfect temperament! The issue is Anna's cat, she was also a stray but just barely got spayed yesterday. We've had her since about February. Anna's cat is the absolute worst beast I have ever had the opportunity of meeting.
She constantly tries to play by attacking anyone for no reason, I have numerous scratches all over my body and every time I voice my concern I am met with both roommates laughing, saying she's just a baby, and zero tolerance of when my cat starts following her kitten's behavior. My cat has never once bitten anyone, never even hissed before, but one day he started scratching me and I just sort of scooted him to get off my bed because I was just not having it. He has never bitten or scratched me again, but I was just astounded. l've recently started locking my cat in my room at night, much to Anna and my other roommate's dismay, saying he should be allowed to roam the apartment freely. All of his necessities are in my room, and I do not wish to keep my door open at night when theirs are both closed just because they think he should roam.
Keep in mind, we used to have our doors open before Anna brought in her cat, so now everyone's door is closed. Why should I leave mine open at night? My cat sleeps just fine in my room. Today I decided enough was enough and locked my cat in my room as I went to classes. I shouldn't have to worry about my cat being let out of my own room. So I go to classes, take my exam, and come back all within one hour to my roommate asking me ""why was Smokey locked in your room?"" Why on earth would someone try to open my door while I'm not home?? It really upsets me because l'll come home sometimes to her closing my cat into her room for no reason. She had gotten mad at him yesterday for getting into some table food, which he'd never done before, and own cat has also just gotten spayed so they were not allowed to be in the same space together, so why was he locked in her room when I came home? Her own kitten is not even allowed to be in my own room for some reason, so this back and forth is really ridiculous and is stressing me out when I have enough to worry about with college classes and work. This isn't the first time we've had issues where they were being hypocritical, where I had to follow their rules but they didn't have to. It's very frustrating, and I don't like that my cat is becoming this way when he used to be so good and sweet. They're very upset with me, but this is my cat in my apartment room that I pay for. How and why am I the asshole to them? Am I really being unreasonable for wanting my cat to stay completely under my supervision?"
300,1juhhcn,Not the A-hole,AITA if i I tell my boyfriend's mother that he smokes crack?,"My boyfriend has always been addicted to cocaine (but he only told me this after years of dating, when he relapsed). In the last few days he told me that he started smoking crack. Since then he told me not to tell his parents, because they are old and are proud of him because of university (we are almost finished with university). So, in the last few weeks I have been trying to help him get sober (he has been using benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, smoking tobacco and marijuana to try to cope with the cravings). But these days he has relapsed again and is hesitant to seek medical help because he doesn't want to tell his parents that he needs a psychiatrist, even though he told me that he needs a doctor. I want to tell his parents, but he tells me that they will take him out of university and that they will be heartbroken to find out, that I shouldn't tell them. But the family knows about his cocaine addiction (and they believe that he has overcome it, but that is not true). I want and think that I should tell his parents, but I am afraid. Should I tell them? Do I have the duty and right to do this?"
301,1juewr1,Not the A-hole,AITA for not sending any more money to someone after I reimbursed them almost triple the amount I promised them?,"Me (25, F) am unemployed and am trying to own some money by drawing. In October of the last year, a lady asked me to draw 3 pictures for a member of her family in exchange of money. She wanted to give me 200$ for it, but I told her I would only charge her 90$ for the three drawings (30$ for each drawing). This may look expensive, but it must be noted that I did some researches beforehand. I charged her for the time the 3 drawings took me to make, knowing the original picture was a full body, which automatically means at least 1 to 3 hours of work on one piece. 

Everything was fine at the beginning. She was satisfied with the drawings I made. But came the moment of the payment. I originally asked her to pay a tier of the total cost in advance as a guarantee. And only when the three drawings would have been finished should she sent the rest of the amount. But she didn't listen and not only send the full amound, but she also didn't send just 90$. She sent me 200$ on Paypal. Now, for those who don't know, personal paypal accounts can't receive such a high amount. And I didn't know it at the time. So she and I received a mail from Paypal telling us that my account woukd have to ne upgradded into a business account for the money to pass through. But both of us had to send 200$ more dollars each. English not being my native language, I didn't understand that immediately. So she sent her 200$ again.

As I said at the beginning of the post, I'm unemployed, so I couldn't afford sending 200$ out of the blue. But I promised her to reimburse her. Then began long months of us trying to find solutions. We both tried. But as time passed by, she kept asking me to send more money to the point of me having sent over 1100$ to ""try and unlock our money"". Every month she comes back to me asking me to pay 20$ to different mails while telling me it's the last transaction for us to receive our money back. 

But I have give her every last bit of economy I had. I have no money left, and my mental health takes a hard hit out of it for the simple reason that without my parents, I would be starving in the streets right now. And I tried to make her understand that I don't have anymore money, but she doesn't listen. at every transaction, I sent her proof that I wasn't lying.

So, I didn't have the 20$ at that time, so I asked her for time to gather them as I could. And this morming, I told her I couldn't keep going on and that I wouldn't be able to send her anymore and she promised mulitple times (as she usually did) that this was the last transaction and that I would receive all the money I gave her back. But she gave me 3 paypal accounts that got each blocked by Paypal. I told her that, and she asked me to buy an online card I don't know anything about (razer gold). I followed her instructions and she received it. But the card in question cost more than she asked. And now she's askimg me more money. 

I'm on the verge of giving up on life and am honestly doubting I will ever receive my money back ever again. AITA?"

F (20) is a terrible driver tho, basically ranting about everyone that doesn't drive like she wants them to. At first I dropped some comments like, ""You drive horrible"" or ""You didn't park in the lines"". I admit I also said some things that weren't too kind, but for last few weeks I've kept my mouth shut only telling her to calm down when she starts ranting and telling her that she drives unsave. About half an hour ago she all of a sudden texted me and M(23) that she won't drive tomorrow and for the rest of the week and will quit our driving community because of my comments. Keep in mind that she never talked to me about my comments being a problem. She also said that she will from now on drive with M (18) (also in the school) whom she keeps ranting about every single day.

303,1judgb0,Not the A-hole,AITA For removing my friend from the group chat ?,"I (f28)have an online friend ( f28)who I primarily had contact with in a group setting to start off with . This friend joined my birthday trip last year and fell in love with one of my closest guy friends ( M 27). This was initially weird because she had several interactions and contact with another one of our friends that he was previously talking with , that warned her he was not the best in relationships. She goes forward with it anyways and to make a long story short it doesn’t go well . He told her multiple times he only wanted to be friends but she continued to pursue and chase after him . It gets tricky where she started wanting their issue to be my issue . So if she was upset she wanted me to be upset under the guides of I should be a “ girls girl “. 

This honestly put a huge strain on my friendship with my guy friend and things haven’t been the same since. So fast forward , there is current group chat that involves my guy friend , and both of the girls he has talked to previously. It’s really odd when you think about it but in a weird way it hasn’t been too bad . However my guy friend has expressed wanting to move forward with his life and having a group space where he can be himself without the 2 girls he has previously talked to being there . So a separate group chat was created for that purpose . My initial online friend is now upset about it and has completely stopped talking to me due to her feeling like she is being rejected . I explained to her that’s not the case and the other chat will be left open for casual talk sometimes . 

I initially did this because my online friend said she wanted to move towards little contact with him and the previous girl he talked to . So I thought great a separate chat could mean every one wins. The new chat does not include either of the girls but just our original platonic friend group . 

AITAH for creating a separate chat ? "
304,1jud598,Asshole,WIBTA for asking my neighbour to stop snoring?,"So I (M19) live with my parents in a semi detached house, and my bedroom is on the side that shares a wall with my neighbour, and from what I can tell, our bedrooms are next to eachother. I don't know my neighbour, and I don't think my parents know them or ever talk to them aside from the occasional hello when they see eachother. So very frequently, my neighbour snores and it's so loud that I can hear it as if I'm in the bed with them. This is most likely because I think the wall between my bedroom and my neighbour's bedroom is really thin, I don't know for sure, but there isn't really anything that can be done about that. The snoring is so loud it's unbearable and when they snore I have to go downstairs and sleep on the sofa just be be able to fall asleep. My parents are both aware of the situation, and my mum's said we should ask them to stop snoring, because it's ruining my sleep, but my dad made the point that snoring isn't something you consciously do, and that they can't really help it. I understand both their points but it's really annoying to have to sleep on the sofa downstairs just to get a good night's sleep. So WIBTA for asking them to stop snoring?"
305,1jucwgm,Asshole,AITA for not caring for our newborn the moment I get home from work?,"Me (30M) and my partner (29F) just had our first child (6 weeks M). My partner is still on maternity leave for another two months, while I have returned to work (9am-5pm), pursuing a PhD in a Biotech company. Our current routine is that she takes care of the baby while I am at work. When I return from work, around 5.30-6.00 pm, I usually need to unwind for 30 min to 1h before I start my baby shift, which lasts from 7 or 8 pm to 1 or 2 am after which I get to sleep without interruption from 2 am to 8 am (6h) before going to work again. When I put the baby to sleep at 1 am or 2 am, my partner, who went to bed at 7 pm or 8 pm, can usually sleep until 3 am or 4 am (8h) (also ideally uninterrupted, but more expl. below) after which her baby shift starts.  I seem to function okay with six hours of sleep, while my partner indicated she needs more than that. I have been trying really hard to facilitate her sleeping at least 8h every night.

However, my partner states that when I get back from work, I should immediately take care of the baby instead of taking a 30-minute to 1h break so that she can go to bed at 7 p.m. sharp and sleep until 2 a.m to then take over. This, in her reasoning, would allow me to go to bed at 1 a.m. instead of 2 a.m., thus getting an hour more sleep and, according to her, ""being less grumpy after work and not needing to take an hour break."" I don't think that an additional hour of sleep would affect my ""grumpyness"" much, I just need to unwind for 30min to be less ""grumpy

I reason that I have no problem taking care of the baby from 7 p.m. (then she needs to eat and shower, so she's in bed by 8 pm) and then she can sleep from 8 pm to 4 am (8h). However, what usually happens is that my partner awakens between 1-2 am and realizes I'm still taking care of the baby. She then gets mad because ""she feels bad for me"" (I'm fine) and ""needs to take over"" even though she only sleeps five hours from 8 pm to 1-2 am. However, I tell her that she doesn't need to worry about me and should continue to sleep until 3 am or 4 am. Yet she says her anxiety doesn't allow her to do that, and that I should just start my shift earlier so that she can then take over.  

So in essence, I feel like I am bending over backwards trying to balance working and caring for the baby while only sleeping 6h to facilitate her resting at least 8h (usually more because she can nap during the day where possible). While she feels I should just sacrifice my 30min to 1h unwinding after work so that she can go to bed earlier and inturn take back over earlier. 

Thus, AITA for insisting that I need to unwind after work for 30min to 1h so that I am NOT grumpy?

AITAH by sending them back? I feel kind of bad knowing the effort she put into it, but it's better than the trash is how I'm justifying it. "
307,1jucpfn,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling my mother brainwashed by religion,"I F(19) was talking about religion with my mother (F45). She was saying how she was thinking about believing in God but not belonging to any religion. For context she was raised Christian, raised me Christian, but i left christianity and became agnostic. We were debating about how evil and God can coexist, and i brought up the question of why would God give an infant terminal illness if he's supposed to be all loving. She then said to me 'you reap what you sow and some mothers drink/smoke/consume drugs during pregnancy.' I told her that was quite a fucked up thing to say because those sorts of pregnant women are very rare, and even pregnant women who did not of  these things still go on to have kids with these conditions. She said the classic'only God understands why' and I pressed her saying how messed up it was to say that, and how she would never say that to a mother's face. 

She then said 'God blesses good people and their generation.'  I asked her then 'if someone is poor does that mean they're not a good person?'She was about use her sister who passed of cancer as a crutch to support her argument(in the past she's implied her sister wasn't a godly person in her youth to say thats why she got a terminal illness. I told her she's been absolutely brainwashed, she screamed at me for disrespecting God and now she's stomping around the house in a fury. She wants an apology, AITA?

TLDR:my mother used the argument that some people who have kids with terminal illness'reap what they sow' so it's deserved as a response to me asking her why God would give kids terminal illness. She now wants me to apologize. AITA?

308,1jucbu7,Not the A-hole,AITA for not walking my roommate home when she didn't want to go to a frat party?,"My roommate (19F) who we will call Emma, and I (18F) are freshman at the pretty big college. We got along fine and were friendly. One thing that I did notice about Emma was that she was extremely introverted. She didn't want to go to basically any of the freshman events and when I invited her out she often turned me down. She also didn't make an effort to meet new people or interact with people in our classes. We have the same major so we have a lot of classes together. She was almost always in our room if she wasn't in class. I never pressured her to go out or to events because I understand that it's not for everyone but I did want to meet people and have the “college experience.”

On Halloween weekend, me, Emma and two other girls decided to do a group costume. The other girls and I wanted to go to a party that weekend, since we hadn't gone to one yet. Emma expressed that she didn't want to go to a party and she didn't tell us why. We didn't pressure her into going out with us. The plan was to go to a birthday party that same night before we went to a frat party. We talked about our plan and decided we would be going directly from the birthday party (which was a costume party) to the frat party without coming back to our dorms. Emma knew this plan.

We took pictures in our costumes all together before we went out, so everyone was in costume, including Emma. When it was time to leave, she said she was going to come with us. We assumed she was going to the frat party too since that was the plan.

The dorm where the party was was a 15 minute walk from ours. It was a lot of fun and but we decided to leave and go to greek town on campus. Greek town was about 5 minutes from the birthday, but a 20 minute walk back to our dorm.

When we get to the party, Emma refuses to go in with us. We were confused why she had gone out with us if she didn't want to go to the party, but didn't try to pressure her into going in. We didn't want her walking home by herself, but none of us wanted to go home or walk her back and come back to the party either. So we tried to figure out a way to get her home and I suggested that we get her an Uber. I started downloading Uber and making an account. (none of us had uber or any app like it) I wasn't going to make her pay for it or ask her to pay me back.

Halfway through registering with uber, she stops me and says she doesn't want to get into a car with a stranger, which she hadn't expressed when the idea came up originally. So now we are standing there, trying to figure something out and Emma is offering no solutions. We finally decide we are going to walk her halfway to the dorm and then go to the party.

Things are a bit awkward now. We used to hang out a lot and now she declines me every time I offer. She's quiet when we are around each other and ignores me when I try to talk to her sometimes. We also used to sit next to each other in class and now she has switched seats.

I don't know what I could have done differently. AITA?"
309,1ju9i0u,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my sister move in after she cheated on my best friend?,"My sister (22F) was engaged to my best friend (24M). They’ve been together for 4 years, and I was actually the one who introduced them. Last week, he caught her cheating. It destroyed him completely, and he kicked her out of their apartment immediately.

Now she’s homeless and asked to crash at my place until she figures things out. I told her no. She broke my best friend’s heart, betrayed his trust, and honestly, I just don’t want her around right now.

My parents and family are furious at me, saying family should always come first, no matter what mistakes she made. I’m getting bombarded with angry messages, calling me cold and selfish for “choosing a friend over my own sister.”

I’m torn. On one hand, she’s family. On the other, she really hurt someone who means the world to me. Am I the asshole for not letting her stay with me?"
310,1ju9bvi,Not the A-hole,AITA for not adding random relatives online?,"My mum has begun pushing me to talk to her side of the family online, and start referring to them as my ""family"" in conversations

I've only ever spoken to my grandmother and my aunts from her side and the rest of her extended family i've only really met when i was a baby

Recently she started telling me to ""add all people with (family surname) and talk to them!"" however I'm uncomfortable doing this knowing that these people have never made any effort to reach out to me in my life. 

also the fact that from their perspective, a random relative wanting to talk to them might be quite uncomfortable too

Should i explain to her that i don't see these people as *my* family even though it'll most likely make her upset? "

THIS SECTION IS EDITED: please see original post in comments for additional information.

I realize, based on comments, I was focusing on the wrong details of the cleaning issues, and seek to clarify them. My roommate cleaned more frequently, especially towards the end, but she never cleaned after me. I had a bad habit of leaving things strewn about and put off things like dishes/trash, but she always left my messes  for me to deal with and focused on things like vacuuming, dusting, sweeping, especially towards the end when I became more aggressive on tackling the flea problem. I say she did more cleaning in my original post, because she would clean 2-3 times a week and generally was good at KEEPING tidy vs my once a week on my day off. I did not realize saying “she cleaned more” would translate to “I never cleaned” 💀 I was not a slob, just lacked the same initiative/procrastinated. Things mentioned in my OG post are what she specified in arguments.

My OG post also mentions poor pet care. Never brushed/bathed for first 2 years. A littler box that only cleaned once a week, and her pet repeatedly getting worms and fleas that led to vomiting and a flea infestation. After 4 months of subpar effort, I had to step in to get the fleas under control and care for her pet.

The deposit was $500, and I used her half to cover last month’s bills that were still owed (~$160). 

— 
On moving day, H verbally said she would not clean and was willing to give up the deposit. There was a hole in the wall(my fault) and parts of the carpet destroyed(cat), so she argued cleaning wouldn’t amount to a deposit/not worth the effort. I kept bringing up the possibility of getting at least a portion back, to no avail, so I stopped pressing her about it. I decided to clean the whole apartment by myself. She left anything she didn’t want (kitchen utensils, USED kitty litter, a couch, cleaning supplies, food), kept egging for me to ditch my things for the landlord to deal with, saying “that’s what the deposit is for” and went silent when I finally told her I intended to clean to get the deposit back.

After 2 days of cleaning the place was immaculate. landlord gave me the full deposit. A week later H asks me “when are we getting the deposit back?” I snapped and I told her I was keeping all of it, and she sobbed. She believed as the person who did more cleaning in the 3 years we were living together, she deserved her half of the deposit and that I was punishing her for “not helping one time”. 

A Mutual friend said I should give H her half of the deposit because the friendship is more important than money. AITA for keeping it out of principle?

312,1ju7vmq,Not the A-hole,AITA for locking my room door so kids won’t get inside and ruin my stuff?,"So basically my (19F) parents decided to invite my uncles (who live together) and their families for dinner. Both my uncles have 6 kids, and 4 of each of their children are in a very close age bracket. (3F, 3F, 2F, 1.5F, 1M, 4F, 5F, 6F). Now I don’t mind them coming over but the thing is these specific 8 kids do not have any manners despite 3 nannies accompanying the the families wherever they go but refuse to correct the children if they are doing something damaging to the house like spilling water on the floor or breaking an ornament and instead the nannies are scrolling through their phones while the children’s parents are having discussions with our family in the living room. Now I have a lot of valuable things in my room like my hand written notes, my iPad, my phone and laptop which I do not want the kids near as I know they’ll cry and ask for it and break it. (keeping them in drawers isn’t viable either as the kids open drawers as well). So I simply decided to lock my room so no one can enter and everything would be safe. I told my mom and she had no problems with it. Now throughout the dinner everything went well until I saw one of aunts with a buzz of kids carrying her 2F daughter outside our room and trying to open it as she wanted to change her. She called me over and said the room wasn’t opening and that we’d have to call the key master. I said the room wasn’t opening as I’d locked it and she could use any other room to change her daughter if she liked. Now she didng say anything just looked at me a bit weirdly and went to the other room. I know she complained about it because after the dinner ended my grandmother was not happy with me and said I was disrespecting my Uncle and Aunts and saying they couldn’t raise kids properly and being rude that they have too many kids to handle and God was the one giving them babies and we had no right to comment about their fertility (Even tho I said nothing like this?) She said my cousins also have a right to this house and to see what’s inside the room. My parents aren’t angry with me and think I did the right thing but after what my grandmother said, im still wondering Am I the Asshole?"
313,1ju7kdc,No A-holes here,AITA if I don't want to interact with my friend when she talks (too much) about her pregnancy?,"My friend is pregnant (again) and she knows that I'm ttc... I was always there with her first pregnancy, her son calls me ""aunty"" and I love him so much!  
She announced her pregnancy last week, she seemed worried about me because she saw me crying and she knows that I'm trying since July, but now every opportunity is good to bring up the topic without considering that it might upset me.  
For example we were talking about wedding dresses with another friends and she needed to say that she is worried about not finding a dress for the wedding we're invited to in September because of the big belly. AITA or she can keep to herself this kind of things?

EDIT  
maybe it's my fault that I always walked on eggshells with her when I had ""things"" that she wanted like travels etc (less important than having a kid) and I knew she was struggling about it 🫠"
314,1ju6sfs,Everyone Sucks,AITA for kicking my MIL out of her own house?,"My (39) wife (39), our two toddlers (2b and 4g) and I live with wife’s mother (MIL), in MIL’s house. Two days a week, we don’t have daycare, and we rely on MIL to do most of the child-minding, for which we’re very grateful. There haven’t been any major concerns with this arrangement for the last 2 years until this incident.

Yesterday WFH in upstairs office, I heard 2b screaming in pain, and MIL asking “where’s the hurt? Where’s the owie?”. Downstairs i see that MIL has placed the learning tower (sort of a toddler step-ladder) against the cooktop of the kitchen bench, within toddler reach of the gas hobs. A hob piece is moved, and 2b is burned.

MIL has 2b leant over to the sink, keeping his right hand under running faucet, in keeping with first aid. I move 4g to safety, MIL orders me to get burn cream against my better judgment, but i do it since MIL is handling 2b and 4g is out of danger.

2b has had running water for 2-3 min. MIL: “now, the burn cream is the best thing for him”, she applies it to his fingertips, where his blisters are. MIL seems now content, but I’m sure I’ve read that it wasn’t long enough (20 mins is minimum). I move 2b to bathroom, to which MIL protests that I’ll wash cream off (partly my intent, but I only cite first aid as cause), he is still distressed, I try to calm and soothe with low voice while rinsing hand.

I later find out this burn cream contains a highly toxic ingredient that CANNOT be orally ingested, it accounts for a large percentage of poisonings in our state and is not for young children liable to lick it.

I’m a little annoyed, but not angry. I’m focusing on calming down 2b, while continuing FA. After a few mins MIL enters bathroom. 2b is still crying. MIL comments how this happened to her son (my BIL), tho more seriously in his case, when he was a toddler.

She then asks “why did he touch it?”, and then directs a comment at 2b, via the mirror he’s in front of: “you’re just like your uncle.”

I say directly but not at raised pitch or volume: “Get out, (MIL first name).”

She gasps: “don’t you talk to me like that!”

My angry, forceful, and loud reply: “don’t you put my child next to a scalding hot stovetop… you didn’t even know where he’d been hurt, you weren’t even watching him! Get out!”. My fury was obvious, but no swears. MIL struck an angry hand to my back and stormed out wordlessly, slamming the door.

Following day. MIL and I have not uttered a word to each other. Wife says:

“Despite that she was in the wrong, she also hurts. She feels guilty over it but doesn’t see as what she did as wrong per se. She was comforting him in her own way. And I bet she feels used. We are guests in her home and using her free labour and then she is told to get out.

Wife suggests I offer olive branch as starting point. I begrudgingly write one that includes gratitude, and sorry she felt banished, but what she said was bad.
No reply. Status quo.

UPDATE - I apologised, in two parts, MIL didn’t want to talk long at first so it was short: “what I said was wrong, I’m very sorry, it won’t happen again”, with a later, calm expansion about what each of us felt and how to amend in future. My apology included the offer of anything I could to to help make it up, she asked for a favour which would help make her happy: some evenings, when consumed by work, I miss home dinner. This disappoints my wife, which shows on her face and upsets my MIL. I’m really glad she told me, I hadn’t known it bothered my wife so much. I’ve promised not to miss dinner any more."
315,1ju6cba,Everyone Sucks,AITA for writing off my friend's friend's relationship woes?,"For context: my friend and I go way back to childhood and I still love the guy, but, some things are better kept to yourself.

Without going into too much detail, my buddy went through a pretty rough breakup last year with his ex. Since then, he's been seeking validation and gets his attention from chicks on IG. One of em, he does nothing but argue with. Another, he leads on and then ignores (she does the same so make of that what you will). Then, there's this one who I'm gonna call ""girl #3"". Girl #3 is an alright girl, we've talked briefly but nothing on a personal level. Anyways, she's been having a rough time with her bf (not gonna go into detail out of respect) but it's looking like they're gonna split. I, myself, don't particularly care to hear about other people's relationship problems, and I tried not to share too much of mine when I was in one. My outlook on relationships is very bleak and very ""negative"" (for lack of a better way of putting it) after watching my parents marriage crumble and my relationship go down the shitter. Anyways, I've seen and heard about actual fucked up stuff going on in relationships, and in this case, I kinda wrote it off because it ain't nothing that serious + again I really don't care about other people's relationships. Anyways, i said that relationship drama is laughable, which kinda pissed him off a tad. So, I told him, ""bro, if you want a pity party for YOUR FRIEND from me, it ain't gonna happen."" Now, he's gonna giving me the silent treatment and tbh, idrgaf but I wanted to get some honest opinions from yall. "
316,1ju68tm,Asshole,AITA for not saying excuse me while trying to get to my seat in theatre?,"I went to watch a broadway show last month, but I keep thinking about this so now I’m posting it.
When it was sitting time, (I was on time, almost early compared to other people), I found my row and I told my mom this is the row. There was a lady sitting at the end of the row, blocking my way to go to the seat. She had a big bag on her lap too. I whispered sorry (the lady was old so I guess she did not hear me), then when I tried to go past her, she stopped me and stared at me. She didn’t say anything and I just looked at her back because I didn’t know what she wanted me to do. Then I just said like “Excuse me” but in a way kids say it when they are not sure if their parents want them to say the word. I didn’t understand her at all because my mom and I were standing there to check the row alphabet and said this is the row. If I was sitting in the last seat of the row, and people come and check the row alphabets, I get out of the seat so they can get in. I never stopped a person to make them say excuse me when I am the one on their way.

317,1ju63ch,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking mylandlord to pay me to move back in?,"
Landlord Broke Lease to Sell, Now Backtracking on Agreed Compensation
Here is the complete timeline:
 * December 2024: My wife and I started renting an apartment for $4000 USD/month.
 * End of February: Landlord wanted us to move out to sell the apartment to buy another property. He offered us 2 months' rent ($8000 USD) as compensation for breaking the lease.
 * We agreed, understanding his reason. We had a month-long trip planned for the first week of March and couldn't move immediately.
 * We asked for more time (until May), and he initially agreed but wanted to hold open houses while we were away. We were uncomfortable with strangers in our home for a month while we were traveling.
 * To avoid the open houses, we offered to move out quickly (within a week). The landlord agreed, stating, ""If you wanted to move out early, I would be fine with your decision. You could even save more money since I would give you the same amount and wouldn't be paying for the rent while you're travelling.""
 * We moved out on March 7th and initially booked storage. As a favor, we asked if we could leave our packed boxes and car in his garage. He agreed, and we didn't pay March rent.
 * A month later (now), the sale fell through. The landlord asked if we wanted to move back in under the original terms. This would be convenient for us.
 * Being considerate, we offered to forgo the full $8000 lease break fee and instead asked for 1 month's rent ($4000) for the inconvenience, plus repairs to the old water heater and installation of a water softener.
 * The landlord refused this, offering only $1000, claiming we weren't really inconvenienced.
 * Now that we've rejected his $1000 offer, we told him we'd move our things out completely and expect the original $8000 lease break fee. He's now arguing that since we ""saved"" a month's rent in March, he will only pay us $4000.
He has been quote friendly and nice to me in the past. So I am wondering if I am as aashole for believing I deserve more.
*Were my demands justified?
 * Is his argument about ""saved rent"" valid in negating the agreed-upon lease break compensation?
 Am I the aashole or is he?"
318,1ju5oey,Not the A-hole,AITA for not taking my friend’s side?,"Not long after college, I was invited to a Discord server owned by my friend already had a bunch of his friends from high school on the server. One of the rules they established when the server was made was that politics were supposed to be avoided because it always gets people heated. A few months ago, my college friend got into a fight with one of the members my friend added a politics section of the old server despite politics being against the server rules that my friend himself put into place. My friend banned the guy who complained about this, and a bunch of people got angry and they started their own server. My friend was invited to the new server, but he joined once specifically to trash us and then left before blocking everyone except a single person on our new server who he was closest to irl, before starting a new one with the people he didn’t ban.

I joined the new server because at the time I was in a DND game with the people that were banned/left, and my college friend got angry at me because he felt like I was betraying him since he introduced me to the group so he kicked me off the server. The weird part was he was initially fine with it, and then a day later he sent me an angry message saying how I’m a terrible friend for joining a new server. I tried talking about it at the time but he blocked me. 

This isn’t the first time my college friend banned from his Discord server, he had done so almost a year before all of this went down because I complained that he cost us a game of Among Us. I was initially not going to rejoin because he said some hurtful things, but my friend basically begged me to rejoin, though I actively avoided going on when he was online for a while. Still, he was my friend and I didnt want to throw away the friendship over petty drama.

About a month ago, I called my college friend to talk again to try and patch up the friendship because some of the other members of the old server felt bad and were considering reinviting him to join the new server, but he ignored me. College friend then sent me an angry message for daring to contact him and idk I just got fed up because I thought he was being a baby about everything, so I called him out for having a woe is me attitude about he whole situation, how he was the one who broke his own rules, and then threw a tantrum when someone called out the hypocrisy. He then said that I should only take his side, and that I need therapy for betraying him.

A day or two later he texted me again to apologize and said he was in a bad mental state because of some family drama. I forgave him, but frankly I don’t really want to involve myself with him anymore, and the rest of the server agrees with me. I was later told by one of the people on the new server, that my college friend has done stuff like this before, where he bans people when they anger/disagree with him, only for him to apologize and pretend like he’s changed.

I feel conflicted about how I handled the situation, AITA?"
319,1ju5m7u,Not the A-hole,AITA for making a list of things to bring for our 4 person apartment next fall?,"I (F19) am a college student and upcoming sophomore. I am going to be living off campus for the first time and will be living with three other people, one of which being my current roommate this year. We have always gotten along extremely well without a single issue. In addition to my current roommate (let’s call her Gloria) I am living with 2 other people, we’ll call them Haley and Stella. Both of them I met through Gloria and we were very excited to live together. Leases have been signed etc. 

Now that we’re getting closer to the summer I thought it would be smart to start thinking about what we would need for the apartment, as we all have fully furnished rooms but are sharing one kitchen together. My grandpa is into cooking and was kind enough to send me a bunch of pots and pans so I thought I should create a list to start crossing off what we already have. I copied and pasted a list of “what to get for an apartment” online and put it into google sheets. This included spices, utensils, some utilities like a coffee maker, etc. Nothing too crazy or extensive. I then shared it with my three future roommates in a group chat specifically saying that this was just a starting point to see what we might need to get for the kitchen over the summer and it’s totally flexible. I did this with my current roommate Gloria for the vacuum and fridge etc. and it totally worked out great! 

But the other day, I heard from several mutual friends that Haley and Stella were “furious” about the list and that they thought it was completely unreasonable. It is mostly Stella leading the charge. Keep in mind, I mentioned this isn’t what’s “expected” or anything, just a starting point since we’ll need to buy a bunch of stuff to be able to cook food since we’re off the dining plan next year and we don’t want to do it last minute. I don’t even drink coffee! I don’t need a coffee maker! Apparently, Stella doesn’t plan on sharing and wants to bring all her own pots, pans, utensils, and other supplies and was appalled at the idea of sharing (she is an only child btw). We got together to chat about it since I heard she was pretty upset, even though she and Haley expressed great enthusiasm for the list in the group chat. She refused to apologize and still thinks I messed up big time. I’m just so beyond confused about the lack of communication about the list, and it seems very out of character for both. I’ve never had any issues with the two and was genuinely so excited to room live with them. They should know me well enough that I wouldn’t do anything malicious! Gloria insists I didn’t do anything wrong and that this is normal for roommates, but I can’t help feeling like I messed up. AITA?"

I would have no problem sharing a party with him except that I don’t get to choose anything for my party only he gets too and my parents are the ones who pay all the expenses. Every time I’ve brought this up with my parents they’ve told me that he’s younger than me and his parents are financially well. This year I’ve told my parents I don’t want to celebrate my birthday and they told that is fine. A few days ago my Aunt, Uncle and little cousin came over to my house. Everything was going well until they mentioned our shared party. I told them this year that I didn’t wanna celebrate my birthday and when they heard that they went crazy. They started shouting at me saying I’m selfish and how are they now can’t celebrate my little cousins birthday especially since it’s his 13th. I told them that’s their son and their issue which then made them more angry. My little cousin started screaming saying it was unfair to him but I told him I won’t change my mind.

321,1ju53zq,Asshole,AITA for asking to look through my BF's phone,"I (F26) am living with my (M34) BF for almost two years. Our relationship has been pretty steady I guess. But I realized any issues we did have were due to our different attachment styles; on top of some stressful transitions with me moving my belongings and dog to his state to live with him after a long distance relationship. (M dismissive avoidant) /(F anxious) We are working towards rectifying those patterns for a more healthy relationship, but the road so far has not been much of a honeymoon (lacking lots of intimacy)....

He withdraws pretty quickly under stressful situations which is  frustrating. We both want a future together and to build a family, however he has struggled to find consistent work while I have been working full time. This allows him to have most of the day to himself to game, DIY projects at the house, or be on his phone. I have tried to be super understanding and supportive to him, all while not having a local support system of my own and trying to get my life on track. 

I know many people that have been betrayed in romantic relationships, which has caused me to have a guard up and standards for what I expect. We have talked at length about trust and transparency and what that would look like for our relationship. I had no expectations during the first year of our relationship, but I let him know that as we move forward I would like us to be more transparent regarding our devices. Personally I do not care if anyone goes onto my phone or laptop as I have nothing embarrassing or anything to hide, I'm an open book. I am not a person to sneak and look through anyone's devices without their permission because I do respect privacy, although I know a lot of women feel the need to do that.

A year after that original conversation, we are moving closer to an engagement in the next few months, so I brought it up again to see if I could use his phone for a minute... He immediately got defensive and said that he gets upset at the thought of me not trusting him and going through his phone. Although I tried to share my feelings about it again, he said that he feels really upset because he is consistent homebody and then shut down and walked away to play video games. I don't feel so defensive about my devices and would be completely open to allowing access. I had no reason to not trust in him because generally I would say he is a solid man regardless of his recent struggles. I just can't allow myself to be naive and assume I  cant be deceived and be completely blind sided like others that I know.

I honestly am so torn because I love him and want to trust him, but I don't understand why he would decide that this is more important. The weird thing is, we talked about it together nearly a year ago and I was really patient and did not bring it up since then. Its not like this is coming out of nowhere.

 We had a 3 hour bus ride back from a meet, so a group of about 16 of us were messing around having fun. It started with some rapping. Much was said out of  fun whether derogatory or freaky or whatever. That died out and half of us decided to play text message Uno. Morale was high and my avatar was almost always next to Brad (23 M) who is a graduate student.  Brad is most of the time getting my draw 4/2 cards, skips, and reverses, which after both of us have won a round he brings up that I’m lucky and he keeps getting my draw cards and goes on calling me a “one hit wonder” for only winning a round. He won the very next round and decides to yell at me “Take that Bitch!” I say back “What did you say to me?” And gloating ensues with the first comment of “Calm down, it’s just a game” from a random person around. 

 I win next and say back “Take that Bitch” and continue with “That’s for calling me a bitch.” He scoffs and continues with the amount of cards I kept giving him and I call out his whining with “Your a grown ass man acting like this and I’m just a teenager” while that moment the group says “A Minor” and I say “No I’m not a minor, I’m a teenager, but you shouldn’t call me a Bitch” and as I try to continue the guys around are repeating “It’s just a game”, and eventually  “He didn’t mean it that way”. I understand it was just a game but I was not arguing over the game but the fact over a silly game I am being called a Bitch. 

Now what gets me is the majority of the guys who are apart of the 8 person group, are my teammates I’m with every day who are either saying “It’s just a game” or in agreement with the sentiment. The guys I thought I could trust (Brad was in another event group so we saw each other at meets but didn’t practice with each other everyday, like these teammates).  So now at this point the whole argument gets shut down and dismissed, which for the rest of the three hour ride to be civil I didn’t say anything . 

 I woke up the next morning fuming not only at the fact of being called a Bitch over something as lighthearted as a game, but the fact my closer male teammates sat there compliant and did not try to defend me or correct the guys verbiage.  I eventually texted Brad and shared my remarks about the situation and got back a sorry, specifically for “hurting my feelings” and “that I took it that way” which I’ve had to make my dues with. I spoke with my event coach about the actions of my close male teammates and we are setting up a meeting to talk with them about it. I’m afraid I’m overreacting and I’m gonna be taken as the asshole because none of them directly said it, and when I brought up being angry about Brad to some of my female teammates my male teammates just shook their heads in annoyance. Before I have the meeting with them AITA?"
323,1ju4vsx,No A-holes here,AITA for asking my partner to take the train over the car,"Live with partner. I bought us an expensive car with cash for which we split the insurance and gas for.

I bought the car thinking we'd use it as a weekend car plus odd trips to the grocery store etc. it's not currently insured for commuting. As such, I went super high mileage for the model year to minimize depreciation, expecting to average down the mileage during ownership.

My partner commutes 70 miles round trip and there is a cheap train that it pretty convenient and takes 60mins door to door vs driving which is 45-70mins depending on traffic.

Despite this my partner would rather drive. They get upset when I get upset about all the extra miles. For the record I too commute and take public transport when I could drive. 

I do think I am overly worried about depreciation, but AITA?"
324,1ju4b3c,Not the A-hole,AITA for not lending my uncle 20k?,"My uncle (dad's younger brother) called me today asking for 20k. He doesn't call me normally and usually only contacts me when he needs something.

I do have 20k and more but I'm not wealthy enough to just give it out and risk it not being returned. I asked him if he talked to my dad or his son and he said he can't ask his son for money.

He said he sold his stocks and is waiting for it to come in but wants to borrow 20k to buy a car. I have no reason to not trust him but I also felt like I couldn't risk not getting paid back. I called my dad and he said to lend him the 20k and he'd pay me back but I just don't understand why he doesn't just wait for his stock money to come in.

There is some language barrier between my uncle and I.

I assume he wants to buy a car asap before the price rises. I talked to his son (my cousin) and he said to just send the money. I trust my cousin more than his dad but it’s still… a lot. Everyone asking is making it seem like it’s not that much or that big of a deal. Very nonchalant so am I crazy thinking it’s a big deal to send 20k to family? 

I feel like I'm wrong because he's still family. He's my uncle. I should help my family but at the same time, I'm getting married this year and I want to buy a house at some point. I feel guilty and like an a hole for not helping out my family. 

EDIT* so due to language barrier it seems like… he plans to sell his stocks. So he’s hoping it would go up within 2-3 months and then I would get paid back. Also, he currently doesn’t have a car because his car broke down… I’m getting bits of pieces from my dad and cousin. But I see what everyone is saying, my money, my call. It’s just the way I was raised… I feel like I should be helping my family. Supposedly, his son already lent him money but that wasn’t enough for the car yet so the 20k I would’ve lent would be the remaining amount he’d needed. 

EDIT* thank you for all your responses. I ended up investing my money so I don’t have money to lend him. My dad and cousin don’t have the money which is why they’re asking me. My uncle knows I have the money because I’ve told my dad before I have some money saved up for a future downpayment. I don’t plan on buying a house anytime soon so I assume he thinks the money isn’t urgent to be used right away. Either way, I’m not going to lend it. I can’t afford to lose 20k. My cousin is just a mediator going back and forth with his dad and me and I’m going back and forth with my dad and him. He doesn’t have a full story either. He said it was fine to just forget the 20k because he could tell I wasn’t feeling easy about it.  "
325,1ju43aq,Not the A-hole,AITA for accidentally revealing my sister went on a date?,"Me (18M) and my sister (21F) live in a strict family, that is completely opposed (especially for women) to dating. That's why in January, when we were at our cousin's (35M) house, and she went on a date with a boy (23M) that she knew on social media, she said that she was going out with a female friend.

The day after, they had their second date, since the first one went well. Our cousin had noticed that I didn't go with her the day before, and started doubting, because me and my sister always hang out with eachother's friends. In order to avoid him suspecting, my sister begged me to go out with them but to keep myself at a distance, so that her date wouldn't notice me, and I agreed.

And since the first the two dates went well, there was a third. That's when it all started to go downhill. They wanted to go on a picnic in the mountains, and since it was really far they would be going by car, and obviously I couldn't go this time, but the excuse we gave our cousin was that I felt sick. Before going out, my sister said that she would be home by 5:30 pm. At 7:40 pm, however, she still hadn't got back, and since she had no signal, she didn't receive our messages, nor could answer them. Our cousin started to get worried, because he needed to get to work, but didn't want to until she returned. He started furiously asking me if I was sure it was a girl she went out with, and even though with words I told him that I was sure, he noticed that I was panicking, and understood that I was not telling the truth.

At 8:10 my sister got back and was scolded by my cousin for coming back late and for lying. That's when she knew that I had basically ""confessed"", although I didn't actually say anything. Even after explaining myself, she said that I wasn't trustworthy and that she would never forgive me. She forced me to tell everybody that she actually had gone to the picnic with a boy AND a girl, but I hadn't said that because I got confused. I did it, hoping to gain her again, but it didn't work. Actually, my mother got angry at me because she thought that I did it for jealousy, and my cousin is angry because he doesn't believe us. So now everybody think that it is all my fault, but I feel that actually it's not, at least not ALL my fault. I think that mine was a fair reaction to her being more than 2 hours late without warning. Had she actually got back on time, nothing would've happened. But also, if my cousin and my mom weren't that strict on her, there wouldn't be any problem at all!"
326,1ju3swu,Not the A-hole,AITA if I didn't apologize to my friend for going to the mall without her?,"I 15 F have a friend who I'm gonna call Milly, a couple weeks ago was March break (spring break), it's a week long and obviously I didn't wanna stay at home the entire week and bedrot, my friend group agreed with me on that one. Milly also agreed but said she couldn't make it because she had a week long language say camp to attend which it like 8am-5:30pm. So she quite obviously couldn't make it to a lot of places and I tried finding alternatives for this girl like skipping or pretending to be sick. She said no to all of that because of something about bills, I don't remember. But since she couldn't make it my other friends and I planned to go to the mall on our at the time 9 person group chat. We were making plans about the drive and everything, a day prior though Ms Milly decided to leave the group chat simply because ""we text too much"" which is really stupid considering the fact that we're friends who like to talk to each other, but anyways all the plans were set and we headed to the mall without Milly of course. Keep in mind only four of us went meaning there were other 4 people that aren't her that didn't go either.
At the mall the four of us were walking, talking and doing what people usually do at a mall when she calls the three person group chat with me, my other friend, and Milly obviously. We both picked up all friendly, we showed it to our other 2 friends with smiles on our faces waving and everything, then she asked where we were and we replied EXACTLY where we were (at the mall). She hung up and left the 3 person group chat. So I priv texted her asking her why she left even though I already had an idea. She left me on seen and had the AUDACITY to put on her story ""backstabbers"". So at that point I'm pissed because one wtf, two I'm short tempered. So I text her again, she replies 4 hours later talking about some ""I was busy"", I didn't buy it. But anyways we got into this really long argument, where she started playing victim, saying we lied to her, we backstabbed her and we betrayed her trust. HUH?! I was flabbergasted, but English isn't her first language so I went on Google and screenshoted the meaning of those words and she still stuck to it.
The argument lasted around two days, the entire time she was putting on her story ""I should dump them"" and other things along those lines. She got into a fight with the four of us because apparently we're the ""core"" members of the group??? Which makes no sense but ok, she also hates Sunny (fake name, one of the four) because get this, he joined our friend group to quickly and he's Latino, mind you she's Latina, so she's racist to her own race which is insane to me. But yeah she said she would talk to us Monday and she didn't, she blocked us instead and is currently spreading lies on how she apologized to us but we rejected it. I have screenshots of her quite literally saying she isn't going to apologize right after I did because the drama was taking too long. But I really wanna know if AITA."

I am finishing up our budget requests to submit to the county for our yearly funding.

My boss has stated that he intends to place the money in the company account and use it to fund other things, such as medical equipment ect.

328,1ju36ul,No A-holes here,"WIBTA if I confronted my sister about taking my chair, after she gifted it to me without asking first?","So, this is about me(m24) and my sister(f26) and I wanted some clarity about a situation that just happened. For context, my sister is moving out of state and is getting rid of some of her things. One of things she is getting rid of is an old gaming chair she used because she would work from home virtually and wanted a comfortable chair. It’s a really nice chair and more than likely worth a few hundred dollars. However, because she is moving, she has decided she doesn’t want to take it with her, so she gifted it to me.

At the moment, she is staying at our parents house and I still live with them, due to  having a poor job, trying to look for a better one, having one lined up before losing it due to recent events (I.e. Government shutting down the internship program), but that is beside the point. My main point is, that not long after gifting it to me, she immediately takes it back without telling me when I’m at my part time job. Literally, I helped her move some of her things from her old house to our parents house for the time being and she gifts me the chair as a thank you gift for helping move her stuff and to make the move easier by getting rid of some things. Then she goes behind my back and takes the chair back without even asking first?

I get wanting a comfortable chair to sit in while working, but at the same time, she just gave it to me as a gift, and while I’m at work, she goes to my room and takes it back without even asking first. I understand that it was originally hers, but at the same time, it feels like a lack of respect on her part. Which brings me to my main point:

Would I be the asshole if I confronted her about taking the gifted chair back without asking first?"
329,1ju0cnw,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my mom to get over herself for a game?,"when i (m17) was 13, my dad bought me the xbox gamepass, and i started to play sims4, there i decided to add my family as characters, when i was 15, both divorced and my mom started living with my bio dad (will call him BD to not confuse things), i still play the game in a notebook both my parents bought, during my time at dad's house, i left it in BD house, both parents  told me one of the rules was not put a password on the notebook, something im okay with, my dad bought me a gaming pc and thats fully mine. 

well to the point bc i feel im explaining myself a lot, my mom entered on my sims 4 world, she saw my character famly, and got mad at me because the family was just my dad and me, not she nor my bd.

Today i went to stay with her for the week as usual, and she  started yelling at me saying how can i do this to her, and how i hate her and BD so much, when i asked her what she was talking about she grabbed my notebook and showed me the game, i explained her that her character died swimming in a pool, it was just an accident, and there is no hidden message, BD entered the conversation saying why i havent added him, i told him that i only added people that i consider family and he went to his room, mom called my dad and when he arrived she kicked me out.

i tried to call her and she told me that until i apologize to her and BD, and add them to my family, i wont be able to go back there, and she was keeping the notebook (something that kinda sucks because i was doing my homework there, and havent uploaded to the cloud to open it on my other pc), i told her she needs to grow up and get over her tantrum. Dad said that i should just do what she wants before she does something stupid, he didnt say i was the asshole but now 11 hours after i feel kinda bad, aita?"
330,1ju0895,Not the A-hole,AITA for deciding not to play peacekeeper anymore?,"My SIL has been part of the family for about 25 years and has just declared she wants no relationship with my father and is done with my sister. 

I care about my SIL, but she has always been incredibly hard on my family, as has my brother. Her family and mine are very different, and I believe this contributed to a lot of criticism and mean comments she has made toward my family over the years. For example, anytime we visited their house, my brother would give us a rundown of everything we did wrong: used too much toilet paper, showered too many times, wanted to do too many things, and so on. 

I used to be very close with my brother and SIL and I usually tried to be a mediator. Also, my family never criticized their behavior back to them mostly because my mom was afraid they would disassociate. When I did try to approach my brother about the behavior, he would tell me she has severe anxiety issues and the family is a problem.  It has never gone well. 

Things got worse when they had a child. She’s a handful and any attempt on my family’s part to get control over her bad behavior when we have her has been a topic of real anger for them. We do not have permission to try to control the behavior on any level (before anyone speculates, no one has ever screamed at or hit her—just scolding or time out). My SIL has decided to end her relationship with most of our family because we have “undermined” her as a parent. 

My mom passed and this has created more issues. My dad ended up with a girlfriend, which was a horrific situation. The anchor person is gone and I became the one they called to complain about everyone and fix the family. I was close with them and I want the family to stay together but I have since left that role because of the mental strain. Now that we have a serious break in the family, I feel guilty and second guess myself. Should I have tried harder? Was I wrong for ever scolding their daughter for a tantrum? Is it choosing hard sides to not say anything and sit in silence? AITA?

331,1ju06d4,Not the A-hole,AITA for sleeping in the bed?,"My sister and I take turns between sleeping upstairs in a bed and being on the sofa bed downstairs.

The system works. Until one of us goes away. Then it becomes a heated debate...

To me, the logical way to work out who's turn it is on the sofa bed is 'if in doubt, whoever slept on the sofa bed last, sleeps in the bed'.

To my sister, I've 'gained nights' when she goes away for a night or two, (because I can sleep in the bed no matter whose turn it is) so it should be her turn. My argument is that her going away is irrelevant as she may or may not have been in a bed anyway.

Logically, it doesn't seem right for any one of us to sleep on the downstairs bed twice in a row, right?

My conclusion is that my way is the most logical, and her way is illogical but maybe empathetic if the person who went away has slept in an uncomfortable bed?

Am I the asshole for saying I should be in the bed again when she's been away because between us, I slept on the sofabed last?

(Yes, I'm aware this is extremely petty and a first world problem but we just had a heated discussion and I figure that's what this sub is for 😅)

Edit: it's not possible for us to change the sleeping arrangements - there's no more space where we live for another bed/bunk beds"
332,1jtzgv6,Not enough info,AITA for calling the state attorney on my sister to get her help?,"I (55F) have an older sister (58F) who is a functioning alcoholic. Over the years, she’s had several incidents of drunk driving with little to no consequence. In 2022, while turning into her neighborhood, she ran over a curb, hit a sign, and caused about $7,000 worth of damage to her car—all in full view of a police officer sitting in her complex. She was eventually arrested for DWI.

My concerns escalated when I learned that she often drives drunk with her grandkids in the car. There was one particularly frightening incident: when her grandson was just a few months old, she was supposed to be watching him but ended up passed out drunk on the couch. The baby rolled over and ended up face down on the couch. Luckily, my daughter (who had recently moved in with my sister) heard the baby crying and quickly called her cousin to come get him.

Before her court date, I emailed her lawyer to express my deep concerns about her severe alcoholism and urged that she get inpatient treatment. Unfortunately, as usual, nothing significant happened because she’s managed to avoid any lasting repercussions for her actions.

Despite these incidents, my sister refuses to acknowledge that she has a problem. I knew her attorney wouldn’t take any real action because he’s on her payroll. Out of sheer desperation and concern for her safety—and the safety of others—I left a voicemail for the state attorney’s office, simply stating that my sister is an alcoholic in need of help. I didn’t go into specifics, but apparently the state attorney’s office then called her lawyer, and now my sister is furious with me. She believes I’m trying to get her locked up, which is not my intention at all.

I truly believe that if she doesn’t get the help she desperately needs, someone is going to get hurt—either her, or someone else. So, AITA for taking this step?
"
333,1jtzfqf,Everyone Sucks,AITA making my roommate become just as sleep deprived as me,"I have known my roommate for over a year. Met her my first semester (in an apartment with private rooms but a shared kitchen), where we were friends but not close. We didn't talk for 8 months after that semester, till we randomly started hanging out that next fall semester. We started to get super close to each other, and now I consider her my sister and best friend. 
We decided to move in together the next semester, living in the same room this time. I've never shared a room in my life so this was a big deal. I made three things very clear: I hate snoring(she assured me she didn't snore), I need alone time on occasion,  and I don't want to take care of her dog. I brought these things up many many times. 
She has had this dog the entire time I've known her. The dog, Spot(a springer spaniel), is a registered ESA for anxiety, and I see why she is helpful to my roommate. But, my roommate also refers to Spot mainly as her ""duck dog""(to help her retreive ducks when hunting). Spot is ALWAYS eating from the trashcan, counter surfing, jumping on my bed(which is supposed to be strictly off limits), whining, barking, and just generally being an absolute turd of a dog.

Here's where the problem begins: this dog SNORES. Like a 70 year old man. It wakes me up nightly. I have tried using earplugs myself, white noise, going to sleep before Spot does, and everything.
I brought up to my roomie that I was upset she didn't tell me Spot snores so bad before we moved it. Once shown audio clips, she said ""well you asked if I snored, not if Spot snored"" Then she suggested trying to deal with it, claiming that I'll get used to it over time. I have not. It's been 3 months and I've slept through the night MAYBE 7 days out of this whole time. I  move to the living room when I can, but there's often someone else out there, and my roommate gets hurt when I move, claiming I don't love her. 
I started waking my roommate up to move Spot, which over half of the time my roommate would wake up, grunt a 'fine' then fall back to sleep without moving her. But she complains about not sleeping through the night.
I really do love my roommate, we're soulmate best friends and I wouldn't trade her for anything. But I hate her dog, and she's hurt by that fact.  I can't just not wake my roommate up because what else is there to do other than make her suffer a fraction of what I'm suffering.
I freaking despise this dog, and the fact that we have a housing contract together for at least the next 6 months kinda sucks. I want sleep, she wants sleep,but neither of us will get it. I can't stand this anymore lol, at least I can figure out if I'm the problem."
334,1jtzd01,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for Stealing My Company From My Partner,"My business partner (20M) and I (19M) started a record label about 2 months ago. It was going great for a while, until he started to hate working every day. I tried to get him out of bed at 1pm to get him to talk to me about the next steps we had to take, and instead of getting up and helping, he would go out with his friends even though we had set aside time (generally from 10am to 3pm) to work. I've been thinking about the situation and how everything started. Now that it's getting worse and worse, I've been thinking about trying to pull everything out from under him. Not as revenge, or as a petty move, but because I feel like if I've done everything for him already, why should I let him keep 50% of our shares? Why should he be able to use $1,000 worth of equipment he hasn't paid me back for? We decided to split everything 50-50, but I want 100-0. I personally don't believe he's done anything of enough value to deserve any profits, or any recognition. If I could make this situation better, I would, but I've tried everything I can to make a simple presentation slideshow, to write out proposals to investors, to explain how I view the business working, the list goes on.

335,1jtz3oo,Not the A-hole,AITAH for not scrubbing my ex-roommate’s fungi fridge shrine before waving her a tearful goodbye?,"I, F27, shared a flat with a new flatmate in Oct 2024. We had calls beforehand and she was sweet sounding and positive. My husband and I had already been in the country and gotten to know the city. We went flat hunting, agreed on a discount, and signed the lease all done before she arrived. I even ordered her a mattress and essentials ahead of time. On moving in day, she was staying with someone an hour away. We offered to pick her up. She hardly talked and when it was time to lift her bags Nothing. My husband carried all the stuff while she just stood around talking. No thank you.

We went shopping for groceries, paid for everything including hers and once more nothing said about splitting. We discussed general roommate courtesy but I did most of the cooking, cleaning, laundry, and garbage. She hardly ever cooked. When I did cook for her, she'd leave it in the fridge. I'd always initiate conversation; she had this low energy presence. I'd check in; she'd tell me she had 1000 things on her mind. I gave her the benefit of the doubt for two months. Eventually I wouldn't cook for her anymore. She'd get random groceries and ask me to split bills without checking with me if I needed something. I had to be insistent before she quit.

She even used my things without asking. She once paid 4 out of nowhere for my sanitary pad use. She went through my cupboard. I reminded her next time to ask, and she sulked. In Dec I had serious knee surgery. My husband moved in as planned initially. We split up all the work food and chores. She'd sit and stare at us when we ate. Strange. So we ate in my room. Still I'd ask her to take food when I cooked even after surgery. She'd offer to help now and then but complain while doing it. One day she carried my bag and complained about how heavy it was. I stopped asking. We stopped talking except for hellos.

She was planning to move out. Given our history, we didn’t offer help. She had poor planning and took two whole days to move. Now, anyone moving out should clean up their space. She didn’t. Her bathroom was filthy. Her sink was gross. Her fridge compartment had fungi. She didn’t clean her shoe rack, her bathroom drawers, or anything. She sent pics to the landlady and said she was done. I asked why she didn’t clean. Her reply? I had so much on my plate. A little help from you guys would’ve been great. I was your roommate for 8 months. I at least deserved a proper goodbye.

I was stunned. What does a goodbye have to do with basic cleanliness? Also her fiancé and friends didn’t help, but she expected *us* to? We couldn’t even afford a cleaning service because of how expensive it is here. And now it’s just me and my husband living here, so we are responsible for the deposit. We ended up scrubbing everything she left behind. It was disgusting. Yet somehow, she made it seem like we were the bad guys. So AITAH for asking her to clean up? Or for not offering help during her move? Or for not giving her a goodbye?"
336,1jtywk5,Asshole,AITA for trying to write the memo/recipient on my brothers check?,"I (34F) think my brothers (29M) handwriting is terrible. And recently we were going over our bills with our parents because we all live together in the same house. And we divide the bills up by person to person so that we can all save money for future expenses. However, when it came time for my little brother to write out his check, I saw that when he gave it to Mom and Dad, his handwriting was terrible. And I didn't think the bank teller would take it seriously if they tried to use that.

So I told my brother to hand me over his checkbook so I could write the name of the recipient and the memo clearly so that we wouldn't have to worry about the check being rejected. And he got all offended because he said I was treating him like a child. And I personally think he was being unreasonable because we don't need a bill to not be paid because whoever gets his check can't read his handwriting.

It resulted in my parents taking sides, with them taking his side because 'He's 29, he can write his own checks'

Personally I said his age doesn't matter if his handwriting sucks.

AITA? I personally think its reasonable because if you saw how bad his handwriting was, you would do the same.

EDIT: Because of the people harassing me in my Private Messages, no he hasn't had any checks rejected before, but that doesn't matter because it could be rejected. And I'd rather not have the electricity be cut off because of something as dumb as his handwriting being crap"
337,1jtxltb,Not the A-hole,AITA for throwing way gifts from a family member?,"I (36m) and my wife (29f) have an issue with her mother. (50f)  She has been buying and giving us gifts that are hard for us to deal with; we live in a very small house, and we're pretty much full.  So when we get an air fryer there's no space in the kitchen for it.  or a bag of clothes that she got a really good deal on - no closet space.  

So we've asked her repeatedly to not give us anything.  No christmas gifts, no random gifts, no easter baskets, etc.  We don't need 'em or want them.

It's gotten to the point where we get them and pretty much toss them into the dumpster 5 minutes after she leaves.  But I got caught throwing stuff into the dumpster when she came back because she forgot her phone, and she was pretty mad at me.  Lots of tears, yelling, saying we didn't love or appreciate her, etc. 

The issue that I have with the gifts is that she cannot pay her own rent.  She and her husband rent an apartment for $1200 a month, and five times in the last 2 years we have had to pay her entire rent or a good portion of it.  The money she is spending on the gifts is honestly our money, recycled back to us, and we'd much rather have her keep that money and use it to support herself instead of wasting it.

338,1jtxlpv,Not the A-hole,AITA for shushing some kids who were talking over the movie at the Theatre?,"AITA for shushing a child because they were making comments over the entire movie?

So... I got into a bit of an embarrassing alternation at the Minecraft Movie this last Friday; I went to see it with my little brother and sister. Now, obviusely it's a PG movie, I'm expecting there to be kids, and I'm okay with that, and there was even two kids on opposite sides of me that were awesome.

However, these kids behind me, they just wouldn't. Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Like they were making incredibly loud comments over every scene like ""omg it looks so bad without the glasses on,"" and ""that wasn't in the game."" As well as shouting off the top of their lungs ""ayo?"" So periodically me and my brother were shushing them, like I don't mind them talking but I would like to hear the movie. And I will admit, I do have anger issues and get annoyed very, VERY easily. Same with my brother, so admittaly our shushing got a little more intense. And eventually my little brother (he's 14 but he's 6'3) I guess just lost it, turns around and says, ""shush."" Then this woman gets really close to my ear and says loud enough for the whole theater to hear:

""YOU KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN DOING THIS THE WHOLE TIME. THEYRE CHILDREN EXCITED TO SEE A MOVIE. YOU GUYS AR LOUGHING REALLY LOUD, WHICH IS GREAT, BUT IF YOU COULD STOP THAT WOULD BE GREAT."" And then magically, those kids didn't say a world. I think they were probably embarrassed because they became the quietest people on the planet which I didn't want to happen, I'm okay with whispering, it was just the constant comments. That made the walk by near the bathroom very awkward."
339,1jtxkhm,Not the A-hole,AITA for pushing back/turning down my family wanting to do something for my 30th birthday next year,"I [29M] went on a weekend vacation to see my uncle, aunt, my brother and his gf, with whom I'm decently close. It was generally fun until they brought up the idea of getting together for my 30th birthday next year and started planning between the four of them. When they finally asked me about it, I pushed back, which bummed them out and other than my brother, seemed not too happy about.

The thing is, I'm not exactly thrilled with my family at the moment. In November (more or less at my mom's request) I moved back in with my folks due to both having notable health scares, helping them out with chores/physical tasks, allowing them to use my car for appts/errands, and being moral support. I love my parents, and I know they appreciate having me around, but truth is I'm kinda miserable. In the 21 months prior to moving back, I was pretty consistently happy, for really the first time in my post-uni life as I took advantage of my remote work to live in different places, with routines, community, friends, and romantic interests (one particular person) that I'd like to get back to. Prior to this, I was kinda hoping to take it even further and move somewhere far away full time, to see if this happiness was actually sustainable.

Unfortunately, because my work is remote and my lack of hard obligations, my family assumed I would be the best person to move back given everyone else either a) can't due to obligations, or b) won't. I'm not sure when I can leave either, because while there have been some improvements, my mom is kinda stalling, now shares my car, always wants me around, and I think knows that as long as things here aren't great, I'm probably gonna feel like I have to be here, cause nobody else would otherwise and I have a fear of not being able to be here in case of an emergency.

Which brings me to the trip. I wanted to talk to one of them about the situation back home other than just medical updates, but the couple of times I started to bring it up they started talking about cats, ordering drinks, the game, etc. They would say ""we really appreciate you doing that"", and move on.

So when they brought up getting together for my 30th, while also hearing from them how it's a ""milestone day"", it just pissed me off. It came off as them kinda using my b-day as a means to do something for them, without giving a shit about me or how I might feel on said ""milestone day"". I don't really even wanna think about my 30th birthday right now, I wanna just get through this time, be there for my parents, and hopefully get back to that life I had before. So I told them it's not something I wanna think or talk about right now, and that I have some things I need to figure out beforehand.

On the other hand, I wonder if I'm being too selfish. I probably could've been more direct in terms of how I am feeling and addressing that, and at the ultimately me being back home is a choice, even if I feel like in many ways it isn't. Anyways, AITA?"
340,1jtxj1h,Everyone Sucks,AITA for asking to be dismissed after working an event?,"I, 18F, am a stage management major at a four year university. the job of a stage manager is essentially to keep the space clean and keep the paperwork organized for all of the cast and crew. There’s more to it but that’s the most basic explanation.

I got assigned to ASM (assistant stage manage) an event with a 65F SM. Now, this is not a show, this is a one time gala event that happened to have entertainment. This was my first time in this position so I wasn’t entirely sure of what this would consist of, and this is also an unconventional event that only happens once a year (we typically work on plays and musicals).

For every single show I’ve done at this school, there was an established procedure of what we had to accomplish before we could go home. Once we finished those tasks, the SM would dismiss us and we can’t leave until that happens. We often have to stay late, but that is expected and oftentimes unavoidable.

On the day of the gala event, we had a call time of 11AM, while the other people arrived closer to the actual start time. We were allowed to attend the gala afterwards, but only after our rooms were cleared for the next day. To be clear, we did not have to fully clean the rooms, we just had to return things that didn’t belong to the theatre dept. We would be fully cleaning the next day. 

Now, I came up and asked the SM what had to be accomplished before we could leave. The event lead (20F) told us we had to clear the tables and lock up. I helped clear the tables without complaint. After that, I asked if I would be allowed to leave now. The SM said “you can leave when I leave” even though that is an atypical request. I sighed and asked what more I needed to do. She had me return some things and then i came back. Again, I asked if there was anything further before I could leave. 

She blew up at me and said “this is why the other stage managers don’t like you” and accused me of being lazy, essentially. Keep in mind, it’s now 10PM and we’ve been here for almost 12 hours. I had been doing everything asked of me up to this point. If she had given me a firm list, I would have stayed another 3 hours if i needed to. But she seemed to just be keeping me for no real reason since, like i said, we were assigned for a deep clean the next day. 

Anyway, I found the event lead and asked her if she wanted us to do anything further than the tables, and she said no. So the SM *was* keeping me for no real reason, as far as I’m concerned.  

But I might have been TA because of how I was responding. I knew i had to stay late but i don’t like having to stay super late if i feel like im not being useful. But that’s a personal opinion and shouldn’t affect my professional behavior. 

So AITA for asking when i could leave? "
341,1jtxifx,Asshole,AITAH for showing my affection to my dogs,"I (21m) enjoy getting jumped by my dogs when I come home from work, when they want to play, and when they get riled while I pet them. My mother however has been trying to get them to be ""Calmer"" dogs and not allowing any form of excitement that would riled them up in the house. However, another of what she's doing is just baring the dogs from anything fun, and normal dog behavior. I have stated multiple times that how she's going about it is incorrect, I mean yeah certain behaviors like trying to steal food, and jumping on the table/counter tops are a great thing to stop, but playing tug of war, showing excitement when seeing their people, the whole shebang. I shouldn't have to not show my affection for my dogs everything I'm home all to suck the joy out of their little doggo lives."
342,1jtwo3c,Not the A-hole,AITA For not spending time with my significant other all the time?,So my fiancé and I are getting married soon and have been together for a while. The entire time we have lived together and I value being so close. The problem is that I never get any alone time. I only get to be alone when I am at work so I’ve been staying late so I can get some space. We’ve had many conversations about finding time for me to be alone but it never lasts. I get maybe one day a month to just have our space to myself. I don’t know what boundaries to set to get the alone time I need. I also have mental health issues and am very bad at always being present in the conversation when I’ve had no time to myself. I just don’t know what to do.
343,1jtwmxc,Asshole,AITA for being judgemental towards my co-worker?,"Hello, I've recently made friends with my co-worker and have learned we tend to have the same hobbies and get along pretty well.

I've noticed that I've been judging him and have called him out for certain things that I find strange or flat out weird/wrong. Here's a couple examples.

He came to me with a story about a girl in one of his cooking classes. He developed feelings for her and told me that his ""cybersecurity friend"" did some digging and found random tidbits about her online. I personally don't think there's anything wrong with looking up someone's instagram or fb but he found things like her personal website where she dances, her youtube channel etc. For context, they've never interacted other than a simple greeting which resulted in me thinking this was a little creepy. He told me he felt like I was judging him but I was just being honest with him in how I was precieving his behavior.

Another time is when we got into a debate about furries, he is a furry himself and I'm against them/indifferent due to their toxic online culture. He told me I shouldn't be so judgemental towards his interest but I feel like I didn't do anything wrong other than give him my opinion and views on the topic.

This is what triggered me to make this post. I told him to shoot his shot on a girl that we occasionally see at the gym that he developed a crush on her. His been constantly telling me how cute she is/how he likes the stickers on her water bottle and how they could be workout buddies for 4 months before we had this conversation.

Our conversation went something like:

Me:""Hey, you should shoot your shot man, you never know.""

Co-worker:""Nah, i gotta wait for the right moment.""

Me:""i think you gotta make the moment, just start a friendly conversation with her.""

Co-worker:""You needa stop pushing it man, i'm not sure im ready for that.""

Me:""Alright if you're not ready for it then you gotta stop making fantasies or you'll end up with limerance dude.""

Co-worker:""You're being really hurtful and judgemental right now over this.""

Me:""I don't understand, how? I'm just giving you advice.""

Co-worker:""I wasn't asking for your advice or opinions.""

We switched the topic onto a different conversation but I honestly don't think I said anything wrong or said anything hurtful. I'm starting to second doubt what I say around him since his the first person that's ever had an issue with me like this. I really feel like i'm walking on eggshells but I don't want to lie to him and tell him what he wants to hear. AITA?"
344,1jtw2di,Not the A-hole,AITA for not including my friend at a solo hangout?,"Preface: all persons involved are of high school age

Me, Poppy, and Rose (fake names) have been a trio since middle school. Me and Rose go to the same school but Poppy currently goes to a different school than us. Last weekend I had just hung out with Poppy and we went shopping and ate food. I never tell Rose whenever me and Poppy hang out because I know she can get massive FOMO sometimes, but I also like to spend one on one time with my friends. So Poppy finds out that we hung out without her and says she is mad at me because she didn’t get invited and we had fun without her. I tell her that it’s unfair to be mad at me when she and Poppy have also had solo hangouts without me, and I’ve never complained or saw a big issue with that. Just to mention, I always refrain from talking about me and Poppy’s individual hangouts around her, but she has never had the same sentiment. After that she called me an asshole, didn’t allow me to explain myself and blocked me. I understand if she was a little upset but I think she is taking it way out of proportion. Just because I’ve hung out with just Poppy, it doesn’t mean that I’m still not friends with her. I’m also a little upset that she was implying that she should be able to control who I hang out with and when. I know this situation may seem insignificant but I love both of my friends and just want to solve the problem.

So reddit, AITH for not inviting my friend to a solo hangout?"
345,1jtvyey,Not the A-hole,AITA for not inviting my “friend” who I had an argument with to my birthday hangout?,"I'm a 17 yr old girl and my friend group consisted of 4 ppl including me. We had a Disney school trip where she made fun of me for crying at the fireworks(wasn't a sob just a couple tears also I cried bc my mom rlly loves Disney and it was nostalgic), she also forces everyone to follow her directions. She's rlly bossy but no one's brave enough to ruin the friendship. She's a loves Spider-Man and I made sure we went on that ride(it was the first thing we did) and she wanted to go again so we did. But when it came to the Harry Potter rides she was upset and the line times and decided we should all leave. I said no, you guys can leave if you want but I'm staying bc this is the one ride I rlly want to go on. She got so mad that I was selfish and mean for wanting to go on that ride. Also I'm in marching band, they're in choir. I marched and all my friends tried to find me but my friend told me she sat down in a Starbucks and just charged her phone bc she was mad. A year later we aren't close anymore bc of that but I still invited her to my bday last year. She was rude and left the group for most of the time. Apprently I was so mean for hanging out with my other friends(not in the group) in the summer but not her. Btw she never asked me to hangout or text at all. She made this whole group confrontation on my one of my friends (she's in the group)bday. She forced ppl to go on her side and bring up ""evidence"" none of them wanted to and said it was an issue btwn us. I didn't tell anyone about this BC NO ONE ELSE NEEDS TO KNOW! Until I heard she told everyone in one of her classes about my family issues. That was out of line and I confronted her about it. She denied it and never apologized when I did even tho I didn't do anything wrong. I thought we were chill now but she still ignores me. I got closer with other ppl this year and decided to invite them, and not invite her. She also didn't invite me to meet her bf(which idc but how can she be mad at me for not inviting her when she didn't). She got so mad at me and my other friends. She didn't even wish me hbd while my classmates did. She constantly tries to find things to argue about and I'm over it. "
346,1jtvxb1,Not the A-hole,AITAH for not sharing homework / notes with my classmates,"I (16f) go to school in the Netherlands where our school system is quite competitive. Easily explained I’m in one of the highest levels in highschool which means I’m quite intelligent and not many people follow this level.

So there’s about 34 people in my class this year and we are in our second last year of highschool. Tests and assignments are very important now since some even count for our exams.

Now I’m not that close with most classmates. They’re fine to talk to but it’s not like I wanna be friends with them outside of school. Now many of my classmates are plain lazy. I struggle a lot in certain subjects which is why I really try to do my best and that’s why it pisses me off when someone thinks they can easily ask me for my notes / answers. I put hours of time and energy into this and ‘you don’t know what their situation is’ I really don’t care, they don’t ever consider my situation either so!

Now I have no issue with helping others or anything, and especially when they also help me and it comes from both ways. But the amount of classmates who I barely talk to and suddenly they wanna talk to me because a test / assignment is around the corner ??

Many people call it ‘selfish’ but I truly don’t care. I worked hard for where I am now, and many teachers have told me that I (sadly) have to work harder than some of my classmates because of my struggles in certain subjects. I know and can say that most of my classmates had time but just don’t start, like when we got time to study during classes and they decide to do other things (which is your own choice eventually but your actions have consequences),

Now I do want to see others succeed but I hate it when people think they can get stuff easily from me while I did my best. Eventually this is for my future and ‘you could just helped them’ we aren’t friends or close, why would I help someone that just wants stuff because they’re lazy??

(I don’t bother sharing anything with my friends or classmates who actually helped me)

but some have called me ‘selfish’ for this so..aitah?"
347,1jtvblp,Asshole,AITA for telling my girlfriend she doesn't have to take my share of house chores when she complained that I don't do the same for her,"While we usually split the chores, my girlfriend has the habit of taking the house work off of me sometimes. Like for example, we'll normally clean the house on saturdays together. But, since she gets home from work earlier than me, I'll arrive home on Fridays some weeks and she has cleaned the whole house by herself. I thank her and tell her she didn't have to do that. Her response is that she likes that we have the whole saturday to just plan something fun to do. As another example, she'll cook and I clean the kitchen afterwards but sometimes when I get home from work she'll have the meals ready and the kitchen all cleaned. Whenever she does laundry she does both of our laundry as well, while when I do laundry, I'll just do my own like we have agreed to when splitting the chores up. 

Recently she told me that she wishes that I would do the same for her sometimes. She said that a few months ago when she was really busy with a project for work for a couple of weeks, all I did was my share of the chores while her own chores were piling up. Like for our meals, since she was busy, I would just order take out instead of cooking a proper meal for the both of us. And I kept on just doing my share of the house cleaning and laundry.

I told her that I have never asked, or expected her to do my share of the house work. House work sucks anyway so at least when we are splitting it together it is more tolerable. And we're a team, I don't want her to be a servant. Like I am grateful 100% but I don't think it's cool how she has thrown in my face how she does all this stuff for me and I don't contribute equally...

I do other stuff for her, I'll buy her her favorite foods, I'll surprise her with fun activities for the both of us to do. Acts of service just isn't really my thing. "
348,1jtuerr,Everyone Sucks,AITA For telling a classmate I'll do his work and then not doing it.,"So basically, we're seniors and I've known this guy for like half a year, we sit next to eachother in criminology and David kinda scares me I'm ngl. So we had a 30 question assignment to do and I ended up fixating on it and getting it mostly done within like 10 minutes, this guy has spent this time on his phone. So anyway he realizes there's supposed to be work done and asks me if I want to work with him on the assignment, I'll do like the first 15 and he'll do the other 15, and so I show him that I'm literally almost done. Then he asks me if I can just send it to him, and as I said I'm scared of this guy and I don't have the skills to tell people no in person so I just folded and said I guess. So anyway he texts me like a week later (which was like yesterday) and asks me if I've sent them yet. And I say nah I forgot (I actually did forget), and then he says ""ahh ok just send that over when you get to it buddy thx"" and then I ask him why he can't just do it himself. And then he calls me a dick and says it's not that big of a deal but he understands. I tell him I'm not gonna do his work for him, he says just tell me next time instead of making him wait. Then I tell him I'm not responsible for his work and he says then next time just tell me, and I say I don't know how to say no to people. Then he tells me to figure that out because now he's late. So I tell him that I'm not responsible for his work, if I didn't send it to him he should have checked in sooner or just do it himself to avoid being late. Then he tells me to grow tf up because I can't say no and I tell him he's blaming me for his mistake.   
Tbh I feel like I'm in the right here but Idk how other people might see it and idk if that's how I should handle that kinda stuff in the future so lmk if ITA or not. "
349,1jttyu4,Not the A-hole,AITA for making cinnamon bread for my sisters-in-law when my MIL is allergic to cinnamon,"I (F22) have jumped on the sourdough bread train. I now make the bread we eat instead of buying it, and when I make a loaf of bread, I post a picture of it and post it on my story. I’ve had several people slide up and say they would love a loaf, including my in-laws. 

Right now, we are home visiting our family. I brought my starter and baking supplies to make loaves for the people who have asked, while staying at my mom’s. For my in-laws, I made 3 loaves. The SILs (high school age) wanted a cinnamon swirl loaf, so that’s what I made for them. My MIL says she is allergic to cinnamon, so I made her 2 small loaves (regular and a cheddar jalapeño). I baked her loaves first to avoid any cross contamination, and I wrapped the cinnamon loaf and put it in its own container separate from the loaves that would go to MIL. When I dropped them off, I made sure to tell them that one loaf was cinnamon. 

Today, while we were there, MIL cut herself a slice of the cinnamon bread saying she wanted to taste it. All of us said she really shouldn’t since she’s allergic to cinnamon. She said she would avoid the cinnamon swirl and just eat the plain bread. After more protest, it was clear that she was not going to listen. She ate it, said it was good, and cut another slice. After a while, nothing happened. My husband and I assumed that maybe she isn’t as allergic as she thought and everything was fine. We went back to my mom’s house, and an hour later both of our phones started blowing up. MIL says I gave her horrible diarrhea with my “nasty bread”, and is now claiming that I tried to poison her by giving them bread that has cinnamon in it. 

My husband has pressed that I did everything I needed to do to keep the breads separate, and that eating the cinnamon bread was 100% her choice. She, and now my husbands grandma are adamant that I shouldn’t have brought cinnamon bread into the house at all and I should’ve just told my SILs no. I thought bringing it would be fine. I’ve been there plenty of times when SILs had cinnamon rolls on the stove, or snickerdoodle cookies in a jar. I assumed that she wouldn’t even touch the container because as far as I had seen, she didn’t touch the other stuff. "
350,1jttxi2,Everyone Sucks,AITAH for purposely shaking the table because my classmates pissed me off?,"So at my school there is a superstudy period, its about 20 minutes at the end of the day where you work on homework or just chill. I've had problems with the group i sit with there in the past but i always brushed it off. I can never really determine when it is going to be an off day with them as they just randomly choose to be a jerk to me at random times. So when i started talking to them about the book i was reading, one threatened to spoil it for me which i asked them to please don't. They then proceeded to spoil the book for me while the other two laughed and giggled. I was furious and when i got into the car with my mom I started ranting to her about how they just spoiled a major park of my book. The next day i'm still upset over what they did, i know that it was just a book spoiler but it was a major one. So when i got to superstudy and sat down i started shaking my leg against the table to annoy them all back. I spent the last 20 minutes shaking the table before i left. The next day my friend (who is friends with one of the people at the table) tells me how i made that person super uncomftable to the point of them crying and sobbing. This surprised me as all i did was shake the table. I know that i acted out of line and let my emotions get ahead of me but I still believe i wasn't that bad. Now the group i sat with joined another group so i don't have to deal with them anymore, which has overall improved my happiness! A part of me still feels bad for shaking the table but another doesn't. I've asked my mom about it and she told me that what i did can't be undone so i can either stay stuck on it or move on. AITAH?"

I realized how difficult it is and I allot time to studying it, and the basics of drawing. I have a coworker who started to paint the number painting book- so all he needs to do is put the color based on the number it is labeled on. He starts selling it online. One day he relates that he calls himslef a painter now, and i asked him if he is learning to paint beyond the numbers. He said no, and he only stuck to that. So I said, it doesn't make him an actual painter. He got upset. 
Now i wonder if I was just bitter and am in the wrong.

Edit: Thank you so much for your input. I've decided to apologize and tell him that i just didnt feel good enough skill wise to call myself a painter, and reflected my frustration on him. The definition i carried for painter was a professional one, and forgot about how it speaks to the soul instead. Thanks again everyone! Have a good day! :)"

I was also thinking about sending a gift card to one of his favorite restaurants but decided against this for a number of reasons (it’s in a different state, it has a general name so I might get the wrong restaurant, the money might be better off donated to the GoFundMe), but would just sending a card alone be insensitive to the situation?"

For context: I’m about to graduate high school I get spare tickets to invite people for free to it. My aunt that takes me to school wants those spare tickets for her side of the family. I want them to invite some people that have helped me through the year this year. She won’t listen to me about it and keeps saying “I need them
More” it’s not like I can cut her off as she can just contact me different ways.

Once I am out of highschool I won’t be talking to her at all!  No I don’t want advice I’m just asking if I’m the AH for this.

355,1jts7ay,Not the A-hole,"WIBTA for not contributing money to the household expenses for paper towels, dish soap, floor cleaner?","I live in an off campus housing with other people. It's 10-person house where no one cleans the common areas or even their own mess most of the time. Dishes get piled daily, no one cleans the counters or floors. We've tried numerous times to set cleaning schedules as a house which completely failed. Apparently I'm the only one who wants a clean space, so I regularly clean all the dishes, wipe the counters, clean the floors, and even clear moldy food on the counter. I use my own paper towels and I've been the one buying the sponges and dish soap out of pocket and I don't charge anyone (people hardly wash dishes so it's not like it's getting used anyway). My roommate buys paper towels for the house and charges us for it. The reason why I don't share my paper towels is because every time we put out a roll, that roll is gone by the next day. And it's definitely not being used for cleaning. I don't even get the chance to use the roll before it's gone because I'm gone all day for class. My other roommate buys that pricey swiffer wet jet that people only use to clean their room floors (I use a towel and soap to clean the kitchen + living room floors) and dishwasher soap yet I'm still washing her dishes by hand cuz she leaves them in the sink while waiting to run the dishwasher twice a month.

The whole house knows I regularly clean the house by myself using my own supplies and tell me I shouldn't do that, but I recently went on trip for a few days and the kitchen smelled like throw up when I came back because I'm the only one keeping it remotely clean, but I was still charged for their cleaning supplies. My roommate also doesn't clean our room at all. I clean our whole room and bathroom regularly and I buy all the supplies for our bathroom without ever charging her. With this all in mind, would it be fair if I don't pay for the split household supplies? I haven't been hassled yet, but I just want to hear other people's opinion since someone on here was deemed the AH for not wanting to split the utilities evenly while they were gone for the entire summer.

356,1jtrq5a,Not the A-hole,AITAH for evicting my cousin,"I 19f was given my Mamaw’s house in January. At the time the deed was transferred my cousin also 19f lived there (B). I was well aware at this time B didn’t have another living situation lined out so we agreed that she could still live there if she paid 250 a month to help with bills and expenses. We also agreed that she would get a job and clean up after herself and her dog. From January to March my boyfriend (E) and I were not living in the house, however we were in and out of the house preparing to move as well as working on the nursery and other parts of the house. During this time we never saw a penny. The house was a disaster the entire time. I also set up a camera in the living room due to people’s stuff still being there and I didn’t want the blame if anything was to go missing. She then proceeded to move the camera multiple times. 
This went on until March since we were not living there we told her she could just pay us half the bills for the last three months or she could be out by the end of the month. For weeks she kept dodging the topic anytime I mentioned it. A week later my aunt came back to town. She invited her to stay at the house without asking me as well as had my “uncle” who isn’t welcome here due to him being a creep. When I asked her about it she said she didn’t even think to ask but she made sure to move the ring camera before he came in. I then decided I wanted her out. I told her to just be out by the 31st and not to worry about paying me back and use it to find a place. She then said she wanted an eviction notice. 
So I got her an eviction notice that she said wasn’t legal and she wanted a legal one. I went to the courthouse and spoke to someone and he said mine was legal and I would have to wait 30 days from the one I gave her to get the one she was wanting. During this time we moved in since then there have been nothing but issues. To begin we have an Aussie. Our dog is trained but B’s 5 lb dog just uses the bathroom wherever. Since we’ve been here anytime she uses the bathroom she just says it’s our dog and leaves the mess. I’m not an expert on animals but it’s pretty easy to separate the stool of a 30 lb dog and a 5 lb dog. As well as every time E or I clean she goes and makes a mess right behind us and leaves it. For example I cleaned the bathroom when we got here, just for her to take a trash can that was covered in dirt and dump it out on the sink.          
Now yesterday, mamaw came over cussing about evicting B. Saying that we are making her feel unloved. And that we shouldn’t be upset over her not keeping the house clean or helping out with the bills the time it was in my name but I wasn’t living there and that she can’t get a job or leave because of her anxiety. I understand mental health is serious but B uses it as a reason to not grow up. I know others with anxiety that have jobs and live alone. She then began saying she regretted giving me the house because I’m just kicking B out to the curb.

357,1jtr7f7,Not the A-hole,AITA for not texting my friend for a few months?,"I (22F) met a work friend (21F) over a year ago now. We quickly became friends and we hung out outside of work too. Last summer, I quit my job so since then, we have been meeting up occasionally to catch up. The last time I saw her was at the end of January when we had one of these coffee catch ups. 

I was thinking about her recently so I sent her a text asking how she was doing, but she responded saying something about my silence which I thought was strange since the last message in our dm was from me, so surely she was the one who was silent? I have been really busy the last few months so I have been struggling to catch up with my friends in general but I’m worried that I really hurt her feelings and I don’t really know how to approach this as when I said this to her, she just put ‘k’ which is strange as she usually sends pretty long messages. I tend to overthink things so she could just be in a bad mood but from how her texts were phrased, she seemed pretty angry at me. AITA for not texting her until now? "
358,1jtr4tl,Everyone Sucks,AITA for refusing to pay back my dog's vet bill?,"I, (28F) live in a house 3 dogs. My mom has an english bulldog, my (22M) brother has a husky, and I have a puggle. Unfortunately my brother's 1.5yr old husky is not trained and has eaten/destroyed MANY things in the house. She has a crate that everyone refuses to use because, ""She can't be locked in a kennel all day!"" The other day while I was out with a friend, my mother, who was eatching my brother's dog at tbe time, decided to take a short nap. Durning this time my brother's untrained and now unsupervised dog got into medicine that was placed on the center of a square table. The location was previously thought to be out of the dogs' reach. After finding the evidence, my family quickly brought her to the vet where she was made to vomit. They could not find any medicine in her stomach, just undigested dog food. They then brought my dog to the vet, without asking but with retroactive permission. The same thing was done with my dog and no pills could be found. All 60 pills are missing. Both dogs were given activated charcoal and sent home. My mother paid the bill upfront for both dogs and expects to be reimbursed by both my brother and I. I believe my brother should foot the bill in it's entirety as his dog not only put mine at risk but it was his untrained dog that grabbed the medication. 
My family's solution is not to keep everything dangerous and expensive out of her reach. (This will also include desks, kitchen counters, tables, etc.) I can't see hanging every item I own from the ceiling being feasible. 
So, AITA for refusing to pay back my dog's vet bill???

EDIT to add the medicine was mine from a pharmacy. I did not pick up the prescription, but it was left on my desk, and I moved them to what I thought was a safer location. 

EDIT to add my brother's husky is the ONLY dog that could reach that surface. She ate through the bag and bottle and was still chewing on the bottle when caught. The only way my dog could have ingested any, was if she walked away while the pills were still on the ground. I've searched everywhere, and no pills were located. The 3rd dog is my moms and too picky to eat anything. "
359,1jtqsk5,Asshole,AITA for refusing to eat off my brothers gf plates,"my brother (21) started dating one of my old friends in november last year. she ditched my birthday dinner (november 20th) to hangout with my brother which i thought was weird so i cut her off. 

 2 weeks ago my brothers gf, lets call her lily, invited my whole family of 4 to go to dinner at her apartment as a kind of introduction i guess to her side of the family. I had been friends since lily since grade 8, i already knew her family well enough so i wasnt interested in going to the dinner which inevitably would be extremely awkward. when i expressed this to my brother he accused me of being a petty bitch and basically told my mother to yell at me and force me to go. 

Lily has always been kinda dirty, she would tell me to ""check her breath"" on days she wouldnt brush her teeth or shower to make sure she didnt stink. when her mother made her do the dishes she would just rinse them with water and put them away. all the times i went over to her house there would be fruit peels covered in ants and just a lot of crap in her room, which i tried to overlook because we would mostly hangout in her living room. 

The day of the dinner rolls around and i brought my left over chinese food in my purse, so while everyone was eating the food (that im assuming lily prepared as it was her apartment) i was eating my left over chinese, i couldnt help but feel as though they were whispering about me on lilys side of the table, but the actual day of the dinner was relatively unproblematic, its the days that followed that were hell. 

everyone is saying i should have just eaten off their plates and not made a scene, lily unfollowed me on insta and tt, its all just so weird and i really dont think it was that big of a deal but now my brother wont talk to me n they saying i should apologize

AITA??

360,1jtpr5o,Not enough info,"AITA for renting my dead mom's house to a friend when I move, despite my sister's request?","So, my mom passed away last year with no will. It's just me (F  33) and my older sister who is 50. My sister lives in 2 hours away in her own home, and I'm currently living in the house my mother owned. When our mom passed, I told my sister I would assume responsibility of the house and pay all the utilities and home warranty insurance. I'm about to move to San Antonio for better job opportunities and want to rent the house out to my good friend whom I trust, so she can take care of the house while I'm gone. She will live there MAYBE a year. At that time my boyfriend and I will be more than financially stable enough to live elsewhere but still pay for everything the house needs. 

Quick backstory-The house my mom owned is a family home, my great grandparents built it in the 50s and we are the only family that has lived in the house. It's a really amazing home. 

When I told my sister I planned to rent the house out to my friend while gone, she absolutely lost her mind and had basically an emotional breakdown. Crying, screaming, and cussing at me wondering why the hell I think it'd okay for an ""outsider"" to live in our family home. To be honest, I'm thinking of all of this in a very logical way, because I don't want to have to pay for all the home expenses while transitioning to a completely new city, a new job, and essentially maybe struggle in the process. I asked her to pay half of the expenses, and even though she fought at first, she agreed. However, time has passed since then and I'm realizing how absolutely ridiculous it would be to leave our home completely empty for months at a time, without anyone being there to upkeep everything. And yes, I don't want to pay any bills during this time. I'm planning on just calling my sister soon and telling her that since I assumed responsibility of the house, it's my call to make and I will be moving my friend in. I don't see her doing anything besides just hating and resenting me for a while, which honestly I don't care about at this point since she's viewing this entire situation emotionally and not logically. 

So...am I the asshole for telling my sister to basically go fuck herself so I can rent the house out and not have to worry about it at all? Especially if this is just temporary?

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who had actual, constructive advice to give me. I really appreciate it and it made me realize we definitely need to get things figured out on paper, and make everything legal. 
When I texted my sister earlier to tell her I was starting the probate process, she actually admitted she wanted to move back into the house, and safe us both the hassle of renting. So...thankfully...problem solved. I'm happy she's making this decision and I know it will be better overall. 
Again, thanks to everyone who saw and understand what I was trying to do, and gave me good advice. "
361,1jtpczq,Not the A-hole,AITAH Because I don’t want to visit my family?,"AITAH For not visiting my family?

For back ground, me, 16f, and my brother, 18m, have always been close. Due to our ages being close, we’ve always been known as twins, even treating each other as such. Recently, he moved to my abusive father’s house. In the house it’s my father, my stepmother, my two little siblings, 6f and 4m, and my other siblings, 15f and 11m live nearby. Recently, they’ve been asking me to visit them more because they miss me. I’ve been putting it off though, which made my older brother angry at me. There are numerous reasons, of which I’ll list out.

1, Erick (my father) and Becca (my stepmother) are currently fighting. 

2, Becca is in the hospital.

3, Erick is living in a garage and coming home late at night to care for the children. When he’s gone, my aunt takes care of them, which isn’t much better because shes just as bad as them. 

4, Grease my brother) has had many sexual ideas and thoughts about me. He’s creeped on me in the shower, asked for pictures or if he could send pictures (to which Ive always said a very stern no to). Last time I visited, we had all indulged in the devils lettuce, which isn’t new to us, and he messaged me that night asking if I wanted to fool around with him, to which I said no and that he’s disgusting. He told me that he couldn’t control it, he had tried but he “cant”. This has been a problem for years, and it’s part of the reason he moved. 

When I told Grease and Star (15f sister) that I couldn’t visit this week, Grease went off on me. He called me numerous names, and called me an “immature child that doesn’t know how the world works”. He told me my 6f sister cries at night for me, which I feel horrible for, but I need to protect myself. A day later, Grease apologized, saying “I’m sorry I said all those things, you just really pissed me off.” I don’t see this as a real apology, but as his way of trying to push it under the rug. I won’t let this happen, though, so I didn’t respond to his message. He’s used to having no consequences, because everyone in his life babies him out of fear of things he does when he’s angry. I won’t let him off so easily though, as he has the gall to treat me so badly after already hurting me through his sexual ideas. AITAH if I don’t want to be his twin anymore?"
362,1jtp8o4,Not the A-hole,AITA? Not wanting to share a hotel room with friend for destination wedding.,"I've seen posts re: this but I have a small twist. 

I (39f) and a friend, let's say Beth, were invited to a mutual friends destination wedding. I booked my flight and hotel room immediately. 8 months before the wedding, Beth hinted how we could save money and split a room, I told her I already booked one and encouraged her to get one with her husband. 2 months after that, she said her husband wasn't going and that we could make it a girls trip. I hesitated and insinuated I might want to bring a date (knowing that might not be the case BUT I wanted my privacy) 

Now, 2 months before the wedding, she's asking how much she owe's for the room. I feel awful because she won't be able to afford it on her own. Her flight is free because of a pilot in the family but the rooms are $2K (edit: for 5 nights) So I, somewhat, will determine if she gets to see our friend get married. I'm nearly 40 and like my privacy, space, etc. She's very sensitive and I know that being honest and explaining I'd prefer not to share the room is the right thing to do, but I know she will be heartbroken. 

TLDR: Friend wants to share a room for a destination wedding but I'm not about it.  She won't be able to go unless she splits it with me.

363,1jtnut1,Not the A-hole,AITA for removing all phone tracking from my parents who keep using it to see my location for non emergencies?,"Here’s the situation. I (24f) am married and live in a different state than my parents. I’ve had iPhones “find my friends” app since I had a phone at 12 years old that my parents set up. When I got married, my husband found it strange that my parents could see my location once we moved out but I just figured they would want it on for safety. 

Come two years later… my brother (21) who still lives with my parents gives me a heads up that my parents were judging my actions based on my location. I figured it would be a good time to remove that app anyways and thus, deleted their ability to see my location. 

This blew up into a whole situation where my parents are now saying that it was providing them comfort and safety to know where I was and it was just a ‘mishap’ and bad day for them. Additionally, my dad decided to retaliate and remove my access from all streaming services he paid for and threatened to remove my brother from the wifi for tattling as well. 

AITA for removing them from seeing my location? My husband has never heard of parents seeing their kids location once they’ve moved out but my parents seem to think it’s the end of the world. Just wanted to get other people’s thoughts. 

Thanks! 

EDIT:

Thank you all for the advice and thoughts! I originally posted as I’ve heard of other families sharing location as adults so I felt like the odd one out for not wanting this however you guys have helped me realize this is NOT normal. 

Additionally I want to make mention that I am completely fine paying for my own streaming services (and already pay for the ones that don’t allow sharing on my own.) This is the ONLY thing my parents had been providing financially. I brought it up as a point of their reaction to help provide context of the situation.   "
364,1jtnn7t,No A-holes here,AITA for choosing a normal job to save for PT school rather than studying an alternative masters due to parental pressure?,"I’m due to graduate next year from my undergrad degree in Exercise Science and had plans to go to PT school for 2 years to become a physio. However, I’m beginning to find out that the PT degree is very unaffordable at the moment for me, especially coming from a low-income family, therefore I cannot commit to studying it just now.

PT is the only thing I’d be passionate and confident in my future prospects in doing, therefore I am not keen on any future study at the moment or working in the field of exercise science.

However, despite numerous conversations about how I am not keen on alternative study, my parents keep pressuring me to study a cheaper masters in Sports Therapy. I have looked up multiple stories of people who have studied this degree and gather it is just a waste of time due to the lack of accreditation for Sports Therapists, with many graduates going back to study PT due to lack of job opportunities.

I would rather find a normal job to move nearer to my girlfriend and build up a good financial foundation before going back to apply for PT school, however, my parents just won’t accept this and keep banging on about the Sports Therapy masters I’m not keen on. "
365,1jtnm8d,Not the A-hole,AITA Spouse wants to leave family after game to hang with Co Workers,"This weekend the spouse & I went to a sporting event with the kids. It turns out that some of my spouses coworkers also went to the game. So after we dropped off our gear after the game & were talking about what to do & where to eat. My Spouse said that his coworkers went to a specific place & I said why dont we go there so you can say hi to them. So that’s what we did. When we arrived it looked like although it was a bar & grill that they possibly werent allowing kids in, so instead of even bothering to ask the guy checking IDs the kids & I just hopped across the street to get ice cream & my spouse went in to say hi to his coworkers. After we ate our ice cream, my spouse messaged me saying the coworkers wanted to meet us, so we went over & the guy checking IDs said kids could come in as long as the kids didnt go to the bar area. Immediately the kids didnt like it. It was loud  between the music and drunk people which made the kids feel uneasy. We went to the table & greeted everyone. Made some jokes about who was going to drink but ultimately we both declined to drink. Within a few minutes my spouse decided that he was going to stay & that I was going to drive home & he would Uber home later. I told him I didnt like that because I didnt want to drive home from the area we were in, I was unfamiliar with it, it was in the middle of the city, & I don’t like driving in the middle of the city. He pulled up a map to show it would take less than an hour & a half to get home, & I still said no, because the travel time wasnt the issue. Once on the freeway it would be fine, its the inner city, with one way streets, tons of pedestrians in the street & drunk pedestrians & me not familiar with the area. Then he said fine you get the uber & I’ll drive home, & I dont recall what all I said but I remember going “Seriously?!”. After that he said never mind that he wouldnt stay & that next weekend he would go out with one specific coworker. Since he has given me the silent treatment, & when we finally did try to talk last night he told me I embarrassed him in front of his coworkers & I manipulated him. But I feel like he didnt once think of me & the kids once he got around his coworkers. We were having a family day & we told the kids no phones for the game. My spouse & I didn’t get to talk during the game because the kids were between us, & we usually talk the entire time we are in the car together.  I tried to tell him that last night but he said that our family time had ended & when we would have gotten home, everyone would have gone their separate ways anyways. Which is true, kids would have gone to their games, he would have gone to his, & I would have done my thing, & we MAYBE would have played a game together but not too likely. I’ve never stood in the way of him going to a bar with his coworkers, at one point not long ago it was a Friday night ritual, & its slacked off a bit, but when they have the time they still do it & I could care less."
366,1jtnc5e,Not the A-hole,AITA for not considering their words after their insult on me,"So I a 19F have recently entered in the world of the place called university but apparently it's nothing like what I have been imaging about.

It's like all my dreams about college life scattered and all my bestest fears started turning into reality. 
Am I the only one or is ""THE COLLEGE LIFE"" is just a myth because apparently mine sucks.

So here what's happened, I am in my second semester and now I started thinking maybe i should socialize a bit (so early to realize right girl🥴) and I started talking to this group of people with 3F and 2M and they actually proved to me that bullies does exist. First they sugarcoated me with nice words, than I did their work(I hate myself for that) and than they started fat shaming me. That's when I started realising about their intentions and i denied to do their work and now no one in my class talks to me just because they threatened everyone.

367,1jtn2z6,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my mom i don't want her talking badly about my dad,"My(16f) mom(48f) and my dad(50m) are in a good relationship now. But when I was younger, my dad used to go on work trips a lot. We usually saw him once a week on the weekend. And I remember getting excited to see him, but a bit afraid that mom and dad would get into a fight again. They fought a lot back then, mostly about my dad not giving my mom enough money for the month. She would slam the cupboard. I always hated that sound. Dad always says sorry to me afterwards, since I had to hear all that. They never say sorry to each other, but don't talk to each other for a couple of days, and let it get forgotten.
My mom always complained to me about dad being irresponsible with money.(not with spending, but he used to take a lot of my brother's money, around 2K, and not giving the money back. My brother was about 6 back then.)
And after they have a fight, or a bit of a heated conversation, mom would express her feelings with acting grumpy. Or she would mumble some bad things about my dad, intending for me to hear. Once, when i was around 9, I went into my room and closed the door while she was doing so, and she yelled at me for doing that. That day was the first time I actually told her that I don't like it when she talks badly about my dad, even though I get where she's coming from. But she never said sorry, and I ended up being the one apologizing.

Now, she and my dad are in a good relationship. I feel so so good whenever they have a cute moment together. But mom still says something bad about dad sometimes, but in a playful tone. I just agree with her, not wanting to get into a fight with her. I know he's not the best husband, but for me, he's a great dad, and i love him. So i don't want mom to say things about him like that.

Sorry, i was ranting. But i just needed to let that out. (Sorry if the writing doesn't make any sense, English isn't my first language)"

My parents have been separated for 9 years and divorced for 5. I am not going to go into much depth of that situation for length sake but she ended up yelling, swearing, and storming out of my bf's parents house and since then refuses to discuss my baby, the baby shower, and anything related. I reached out to her back in January since she demanded on having a separate shower for my baby. Even though I have told her countless times I didn't want to be having a million different events for the baby. I said my dad's wife offered to step away so my mother could feel more comfortable but she flat out refused to go to the shower simply because my dad would be there. She is now saying I hid the event from her and her side of the family(it's just her, my 3 siblings, my SIL and a niece and nephew) when I've told her several times I'd love for my mother to be there but she kept insisting she couldn't because of my dad being there.

The problem is that during our conversations, she always alludes to never having any money or being tight of funds, yet all of the plans she suggests usually require money. I have suggested us doing cheap or free things like going to breakfast, taking our kids to the park, getting a pedicure, etc. but she is very adamant about going out to a lounge or club and ordering a bunch of food/drinks, which gets expensive quickly!

372,1jtmbab,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to go on a week-long vacation with my husband's family for his dad's 60th birthday?,"My husband (33M) and I (33F) have been together since we were 16. In all the years we've been together, his family has never really made an effort to get to know me or build any kind of real relationship. Meanwhile, my husband and I are both very close to my family — holidays, birthdays, casual hangouts, all of it.

After we got married a couple of years ago, not much changed. His family still has very limited contact with us (months go by without a call or text) — mostly just showing up to dinner for birthdays and major holidays . I’ve always felt like an outsider, and it’s hard for me to show up and pretend like we’re one big happy family when the truth is they’ve never really included me or made me feel welcome. Some examples: 1) his mom's birthday is just two days away from mine, and she refused to acknowledge my birthday until we were married. 2) I have always passed on gifts for holidays, anniversaries and mother's day etc. even though if I was not invited or included, but the gesture has never been reciprocated until after we were married and my husband had to make a point to his mom to get me a Christmas gift. 

Now, his dad is turning 60, which I understand is a big milestone. I’m happy to celebrate with them and attend any kind of party or dinner. But here’s the issue: his mom wants to plan a week long trip to an all-inclusive resort to celebrate and expects us to join.

I’ve already voiced to my husband that I’m not comfortable with this. Aside from the obvious cost (around $4,000 for both of us), I really don’t want to spend 7 days of my limited vacation time making small talk and pretending to be close with people who’ve never shown real interest in getting to know me. I feel like I’m being asked to fake a relationship that doesn’t exist, and honestly, that feels draining and disrespectful to my own time and emotional energy. It just feels fake.

My husband understands how I feel, but I can tell he’s torn. I told him I support him going if he wants to, but I personally don’t want to go.

So... AITA for not wanting to spend a week on vacation with my in-laws?"
373,1jtlry2,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if i didnt let my classmates borrow my school book for that class?,"To start of, we get our books each grade by the school. They are ours for that year and we are required to return them in at the end if the year, so its not like I paid for my school books.

So there are these two girls in my class who allways sit right next to each other, and they both have scoliosis. The relevancy of their scoliosis in this matter is due to the fact that they litterally dont bring ANY of the issued school books the recoved because they claim its ""too demanding in thier backs"" or ""its hard for them to carry thier backpacks up and down the stairs"" (we are on the second floor), instead opting on borrowing them from somobody else every class. They just come with a backpack that holds a simple pencil case and 5-7 light, paper-back notebooks and nothing more. 

I sit next to my brother, and both of us are kind, so most of the time they borrow one of our books, leaving us with one book to share. I dont mind letting them borrow books once or twice, but EVERY DAY is a bit of a stretch in my opinion. Its becoming so much of a problem that my brother started making comments about me letting it borrow the book to them.

I really want to just start refusing them the books, just like some of my friends have been doing, as in my opinion thier scoliosis isnt my problem. I think that if its too demanding for them to carry thier required books, they should get a backpack on wheels, and the fact that it will make them look ""silly"" in my opinion doesnt hold any water as they have a *disability* (like my glasses), so they either suffer but look cool, or look silly but be able to function normally. 

The problem is i havent refused them any of the books they require for now, because I haven't had the heart to do it, but i want it to stop as i feel like they are using me and manipulating me for my kindness, especially because they are very passive aggressive to me, but not outright mean, which further tells me they are using me.

So, would I be the asshole if i didnt let them borrow the book for that class period?"
374,1jtk13q,Not the A-hole,AITA for Refusing to Give a Classmate some Notes for Homework,"I (18F) am a student in college, in my second year studying for an advanced diploma in marketing. Next year I will be studying for my Bachelors Degree in Buisness Enterprise. Each year, the class has to nominate a class representative and since no one wanted to take responsibility, I decided to become the representative. I was nominated twice in a row per year. My job is to collect any queries the class on the whole had and to forward our concerns to lecturers, directors, etc. 

I had no friends in class. When it came to group work, no one would offer me to join them in their group, I would be placed automatically with anyone who's missing a group member.

The end of the scholastic year is near and we are in our crucial month when it comes to assignments. Earlier this year, the teachers had a strike and some students didn't bother attending class as they didn't know if the strike will continue or not. If it did, we would have gotten all automatic passes in our units which aren't valid grades on our certificate and we would find it difficult applying to jobs or other learning opportunities.

I had students ask me to send them notes, and I would tell them that the notes our teachers uploaded are on Moodle (the class VLE we use). Most of them would thank me and it stops there. Sometimes, students may have queries with homework and ask in the group chat. Most times, the classmates answer each other. Sometimes, when I ask the chat myself, I either get any answers late or they ignore my message in the first place. Today, another student (19F) asked me for notes. Just like I tell the others who ask me, I just tell them where the teacher's notes are, and she proceeds to ask me for personal notes that I've written in class, to help her with an assignment she hasnt started yet. I refused to give her my notes but out of pity I decide to explain the assignment better to her. She said thanks and went ahead to ask the same question in the class group chat. I publicly told her the same thing (that notes are on the VLE).

On second thought, I feel like I'm a jerk. Though at the same time, I just don't want to be taken advantage of.

So AITA?"

She reached out to my Dad to ask me if I wanted to be in the Will and I refused straight away. I don't want money from her death just because we happen to share some blood. However my younger Brothers think I\`m an asshole for refusing to be in the Will. I told them, at the end of the day it's her money and it's her decision what she wants to do with it. I couldn't care either way.

What is annoying me is the fact that she reached out to my dad to ask me, it just feels like a power move to me. And the fact my family can't see that and act like I\`m the asshole has me second guessing  myself. So am I the asshole?"
376,1jti7gp,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting mad about my MIL coming to stay with us for 4 days?,"We (my bf and I) live in a 43 foot trailer and I work a corporate job from home. It’s basically a studio apartment. We have a mini golden-doodle and a mini schnauzer. I am a heavy smoker, and don’t advertise it to the world. (Gardener not tobacco). My boyfriend works 7 days a week, 12 hour shifts for 2-3 months at a time. Right now he’s on a job where he is working those hours. His mother is 70 y/o and Christian Baptist from the South. She lost her husband last year in August and she is one of the sweetest people I know. So she’s been lonely. She’s been talking about visiting us for some time, but we always make time to come visit her instead because our living situation. She is on the school kid’s schedule so she gets spring break off work. She’s been wanting to “get away” from home for a while. We’ve bounced the idea of her coming to visit us for a while now, but agreed that it wouldn’t work well and we should push it off. 

He came home from work yesterday and let me know that his mother would be coming to stay with us this coming weekend from Saturday-Tuesday. And he would be able to take Sunday off to spend time with her. 

1. I’m just appalled that he made plans for MY WEEKEND and then came home and told me like it wouldn’t be a big deal to me? 

2. I’m also really uncomfortable with the fact that I wont have any space or privacy to work on Monday and Tuesday. Also, wtf is she going to do for those days? The closest gas station is 10miles away and actual town is 25miles. It’s just woods around us. 

3. She hates our dogs jumping on her and can’t be left alone with them. I have to referee because she’s so dramatic about them. 

4. I smoke every hour or two in my bathroom. So it doesn’t get very smelly outside that room. Her husband died last year from complications due to lung cancer and heart disease. So she’s not very nice about people smoking. She has no idea that I smoke. (Or hasn’t mentioned smelling it on me yet).

My boyfriend is usually considerate and unbelievably loving. But fuck, every year or so he pulls a stunt like this that really makes me wonder how considerate he actually is. We just got engaged too. 

I need to know if I should push the issue or just leave it. AITA??

377,1jti4x4,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not talking with the transfer student anymore, ignoring them completely and setting boundaries, after I found out about their true colors?","I (15F) is graduating from 10th grade right now and I want to know if I'm the asshole in the situations I got into these school years.. flashback to the first weeks in school, I approached this transfer student, let's call her ""Lily"", she was nice at first. We talked a little at that time since she's already in a friend group. I noticed that she's always left out and I felt bad until the truth came out. The truth came out because Lily suddenly cried in recess and told everyone that her friend group was ignoring her and leaving her out in activities. But that was actually not true because she was leaving herself out on purpose and was the one who was ignoring the group of friends. The group of friends just decided to give her some space but she took this as them not wanting her and ignoring her. I felt off about that. I felt like she was trying to get attention or make some drama, there's also some times where she'd ignore me also. I then decided to avoid her a little but I continued to talk to her because I wanted to give her another chance, maybe it's just a one time thing, I thought.

Fast forward to 2nd qr, we had a group competition. Lily was one of them and I'll get to the point, she didn't do anything and got mad when I told her to do something, she looked like a child who got scolded. What happened was we ran out of rocks (nature was the theme) and since all of us was doing something except her,I ordered her to grab more rocks, we were in a hurry because there's 10 mins left. And she was slow as fudge when getting rocks, she took a long time and got back with only small amounts of rocks THREE times and I asked her why.. she told me there's no more rocks left outside and when I went outside myself I saw billions of rocks. (We didn't finish it)

After that, I completely stopped talking to her. I only talked to her if it's important, etc. but she stopped too since she realized the message that I don't wanna be close anymore, and dealing with someone like her is taking a roll on my mental health. There's more things she did to me actually but it's alot so I'll list some. First she accidentally hurt me physically by holding my hand too hard and swinging her hand on my shoulder, smth like that. It hurts and I told her that, but she stared at me like a deer on headlights, didn't say sorry, and continued swinging her hand and holding my hand too hard at next encounters. It stopped when I stopped talking to her.

Everything was peaceful, I stopped talking to her, and focused on school. Meanwhile she's getting closer to my friend group. What I do is avoid my friend group when she's with them but I'll continue bonding with them when she's away. I'm not saying I don't want her to talk to my friends, I'm okay with that, just not me. What hurt my feelings is that when my friends force me to be close to her.. I don't want to, it's my choice to choose who I want to be close and friends with. thankfully they stopped trying, for now.

So, AITA?"
378,1jthjbv,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I were to snap at my friends for leaving me alone in class and not advancing on our projects?,"So, me and two friends are in a group project for two classes. We are on our last year of college and so, along with the typical college projects and exams, we also have to do a final project to show what we’ve learned all these four years.

We only have classes on Mondays and Tuesdays for four hours each day, so that’s good. The thing is, lately they haven’t been coming to classes. So, if the teacher says something important, I’m the one who has to tell them through our group chat and they thank me for telling them. If it had only been once or twice, I wouldn’t have minded, but it’s been a month in which they sometimes show up to one class, and never show up to the other class.

They say the first period is boring because the teacher doesn’t really know how to explain the theory and I get it! I get incredibly bored as well, but I still come to class because I chose the continuous evaluation instead of the final evaluation. I get that they’re busy and worried about the final college projects and that one of them has work as well, but I’m tired of being the messenger in the group and how when I tell them they should go to class they’re all like “Yeah, you’re right” only for them to not show up!

I did a project in which we had to explain what we were going to do for our final project and had to add 40 bibliography citations on my own when it was supposed to be a group project. On one of the classes, our teacher gives us time to do the group project, so what, I’m expected to do the whole project by myself for two hours? No!

Kinda needed to vent, sorry, but would I be the asshole if I were to snap at them?

Edit to add that they're hardworking and we did do a brainstorm for the topic of our final project, I'm mostly pissed that I have to keep being the one to tell them what they missed because they're too busy to come to class. We haven't even started the work, I'm just pissed about that. Like, what'd happen if I were sick, couldn't go to class and the teacher said something important? That's what I'm angry about."
379,1jtg6xv,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to keep sending money for my partner’s family,"I (29M) am in a relationship with my partner (28M), who comes from a culture where parents are seen as infallible and can ask for anything without question.

When we decided to move to another country, my partner’s parents generously helped fund the move. Over time, we managed to pay them back, and even more than what they initially contributed. My partner’s mother regularly asks for money for things like bills, office trips, or even luxury items like a new iPhone. This started as small, occasional requests, but it’s been ongoing for three years now. I initially managed to convince myself how it’s fine and a little sum won’t hurt but lately it’s really wearing me down.

For context, we’ve also covered other expenses, like paying for legal fees for my partner’s dad when he got into trouble, sending money for birthdays, and even paying for my partner’s brother’s migration fees which ended up being a waste of money. Not to mention money for chemo (his mom HAD cancer but is fine now) and random funds being sent for their afternoon tea.

I’ve tried talking to my partner multiple times about setting boundaries with his family. I’ve explained that this constant financial support is draining, and that if we continue like this, his dreams of buying a new car or a house won’t be possible. He kept telling me he has dreams, which I sometimes hate when it turns into a rant how the cost of living has been getting worse. I’ve suggested he have a conversation with his mom to set some limits on how often they ask for money. However, he refuses to do this and says that I’m in the wrong, that we should separate our finances. 

AITA for refusing to keep sending money to his family?"
380,1jtfwsc,Not the A-hole,AITA for not including my husbands siblings in life events for our kids?,"To give some background My husband (m34) and I (f35) went no contact with my husbands parents about 8 months ago. The first 4 months we were just “taking space” sparked by a phone call we had with them. They opened the door on the phone call and said, “ I hope if there is anything we have done to hurt you we can talk about it in the moment” my husband has been extremely hurt by many of their actions and he took the opportunity to try to express those in a calm environment. (My husband grew up in a house where he always felt he had to tiptoe around his Moms mood and his Dad would defend that. When I married into the family I was all but told who I should like in the family and who I shouldn’t if I was going to make his mom like me.) 
 
Anyway, he told them about some past ways he had been hurt or felt lines had been crossed, They ranged from, “you decided not to invite us to Dads 50th because we wouldn’t tell you if we were free without knowing what was going on”(‘they would insist on blind time commitments a lot) as well as… far worse situations growing up that I won’t go into here. They didn’t apologize for any of it, but rather told my husband why he was to blame for all of the situations. The conversation blew up on both sides and We decided to take space through the holidays.  4 months later we tried to meet up to reconcile (We initiated the meeting) but it went very bad and we continued on with no contact. 

During those initial 4 months there were a couple religious life events for our kids. His parents love our kids very much but we didn’t want our kids to be used to relieve tension or for their events to be tense. 

Now here’s where we may be in the wrong- as I said before there is a lot of tiptoeing and making sure mom is okay in his family. His siblings are all young adults, but 2 of them still live at home and one of them lives very close to his parents and we thought it would cause a lot of issues for them in those initial few months if we invited them to the events for our kids but not his parents. We felt even more sure of that decision after we found out his parents were ignoring any aunts or uncles who did go to them. 

After the reconciliation meeting there was a court date- I told you it went bad- and we had a no contact order with his mom which extended over one of our kids birthdays so we didn’t invite his siblings to that either but we have a couple more birthdays for our kids coming up. My husband wanted to invite the siblings since the no contact with his parents has turned into a longer thing, but when he invited them they told him he is very rude for assuming they would want to see us after we didn’t invite them to those other events/holidays and they would only consider it if we reconcile with his parents or find common ground. We don’t want a relationship with his parents without boundaries being respected. We completely understand why his siblings are hurt by not being invited to those events though. AI(we)TA?

381,1jtfo72,Not the A-hole,WIBTA If I told my friend to stop bringing his girlfriend to everything we do,"My friend (m22) and I(m23) have been friends for almost 10 years now and he recently got a girlfriend (first girlfriend fyi) which I am super happy for.

But I hate every time we hang out we have to see eat with her or have something to do with her. While I don't have a grudge against her or anything (I actually like talking to her), I just don't really enjoy third wheeling and really I just want a day with just me and my best friend.

I genuinely understand why he's doing what he's doing (I've been in a relationship before) but I feel like he can simply go a day without seeing her.

However I feel like it crossed the line a couple months ago when there was a time crunch for something we had to do and he was just hanging out at her place when I was waiting for him to get home so I could drive him to where we needed to be. And after getting to my place he ended up leaving and going out with her. Like bro you literally just saw her like 2 hours ago.

Ever since then I've been trying to tolerate it and not make it a big deal than it is to avoid fights or anything like that but I feel like now I can only tolerate so much.

And just this week I invited him for dinner and the day before he just texts me that his girlfriend was going to be there. I literally made the plans and asking me if she can come didn't even cross his mind.

I'm just really worried that he's changed because of this girl and if I do anything that potentially sounds like I'm disrespecting her it would end our friendship (I have very few friends so I can't afford to lose one).

Would I be the asshole if I simply asked him to stop bringing her to our hangouts just because I want a day with my friend alone?

Edit: thanks for your input everyone, from what I’m hearing. I think it’s just best if I tolerate it for the time being until their magic dies out"
382,1jtfksz,Not enough info,AITA for my frustration around my mom for not respcting us?,"My mom has lead a hard life, abused by her parents and she never really grew up. Had me (20 F) with my dad and her current husband. I have four little siblings. 
I don't think she wanted any of us maybe eventually she did want kids, but she never lived her life. She has us too early, not teen but she disnt quite chose her life  her parents did.Now my grandparents are the terrible, racist, vulgar and about as 1950s as you could get. Gosh they didn't even like the fact that my dad was *gasp* not an eagle scout. Hard to grow up under, I know. Still. Everything seems like it's a ""us vs her"" scenario. We're autistic, including my dad, and it's always ""Oh cause you're autistic you don't understand"" or something about ""Are you handicapped? Do you all have some sort of mental handicap that makes it so you can't do these things or remember to do your chores?"" She doesn't outwardly say she thinks we're stupid. I flat out told her her parents are stupid and that the trauma didn't stop with her. It ended poorly. Here are all the points I brought up.

She has tried hard to break the generational trauma, but it's hasn't completely worked. Does she beat her kids? No. Does  she talk about how we're lucky because she doesn't treat us the way her parents treated her? Yeah. She talks about how we're so frustrating and how she shouldn't have to ask us to do our chores. She doesn't. I'm 20, I've lived on my own before and I was fine. She talks about how there are so many things she didn't get to do in her life before us. About how having kids ruined her health and the way her body looks. (Side effects of her #&_+_++# parents.) Apologies that was more satisfying than typing any possible word. She hates our religion, mostly because she got stuck on the wrong part of it, and hates the fact that I want to go on a mission with our church as our sponsor. Never in my life has she supported something I liked doing. All of highschool, even my choice to go on a mission or publish a book. Nothing is acceptable. Hair, bodyweight, stress eating. Then tonight she moped about saying how she must make us all miserable because we just ""don't seem to be happy anymore."" She's not mature enough to handle criticism, or corrective feedback The chores aren't that bad. It's more of she sees dog footprints or hair and flips out. She doesn't make us all miserable, but the lack of respect and boundaries does frustrate us. The lack of trust in her adult children is offensive. I don't know if we're slow, and ""mentally handicapped"" but as our mother shouldn't she love us anyway? AITA for having my feelings hurt and not trusting her with anything? 
If we talk too loud or laugh or be normal we get shushed and told ""woah you all are loud/excited/tired today"" no music, not video games. Um. Yeah... There you go. "

Yesterday it was of my friend’s birthdays and she had a small brunch for us to celebrate and of course, we took some pictures on her phone during. Afterwards, I asked for the photos in a group chat by saying “where’s the pics loca” and she responded “where’s my birthday post loca”. I told her that was the reason I was asking for the pictures and she replied back saying that we have other better ones and that the ones we took didn’t come out that good. I could tell she was actually upset now. I just responded after saying that I wanted to see those pictures before I made a post and she left the message on read. For context, my birthday is the day after hers and as we were sending these messages, it was well past midnight and every year she sends me a happy birthday but for this one she hasn’t.  

I’m not sure if I’m reading too much into it or if I’ve been a bad friend and she didn’t know how to talk to me about it until these texts but I feel really guilty. The other girl in the chat liked her original message and i can’t help but think that maybe she feels the same way too.

Both of these cats I completely pay for, including vet bills, food, original adoption cost, and anything else. They have lived with me since before my parents separated, and stayed with my dad due to him keeping the house. My dad moved into a new house (and took the cats with him) due to him remarrying and us needing more space. 

My stepsister (14) had started to become really attached to one of the cats, and would often care for him when I was there. 

Since I started staying at my mom's more, I wanted to bring them to her house, so I could be with them more often and better care for them. My dad originally told me that was fine, but changed his mind last second once my stepsister became upset that I was taking them. 

I ended up getting permission to take them, and did, but was told off for hurting my stepsister's feelings. 

I feel like I may have gone too far, and been very selfish by taking them, since I know she was very attached to one of them. They're my cats, but she still took care of them while I wasn't there, and grew close to them. 

I don't regret it, since I think it was my decision in the end, but I'm worried I made the wrong, and unkind decision.

The two of us met on our dorm floor freshman year and overtime, Bella made a few friends who I befriended through her. We've always been pretty different with me being a homebody while she always went out on weekends. Since she has a summer birthday, she hasn't been able to go to clubs until this school year. Her and the group have gone out a lot while I always stayed in, even before they started clubbing. I would just hang out with them during the day or host potlucks from time to time. 

With this being my last semester before student teaching, I've been super busy so we haven't even been able to hang out as much. Because of this, we planned one night where they would come over to my place, get baked, do some baking, and watch horrible movies, and then another night I go out to a club with them. That way we all can do stuff together that we all can enjoy. 

We had planned to go out a few weeks ago, but I had to bail the day before because my family's dog was hit by a car and I wanted to be with him in case those were his final moments (he is okay and recovering now). So we rescheduled for the other night. 

Earlier in the morning though, I was in the ceramics studio working on my final when I cut my hand with a rusty tool. I don't know how but it was a really bad cut and I needed a few stitches plus a tetanus shot. It was only two stitches but I still made the decision to cancel again. I was worried about my hand getting hurt because I know the clubs around here are always so packed and I didn't need people accidentally bumping into it while it was still sore. If the stitches weren't so new, I would have gone, I swear. 

I apologized to Bella and offered for us to go next week, and I hoped that she would understand but instead she left me on read for an hour before sending me a lengthy text about how upset she is that I had bailed again. She expressed her frustration that I never went out with her and the group, and that the most we ever did nowadays was study and get coffee. Despite these two times being the only times I ever bailed, it hurt because this was supposed to be our big hangout. Her and the rest of the group all thought that my injury shouldn't have been a problem, and that they could've accommodated me. They think I am being a jerk because I've bailed two times now. I feel bad, I really do. But none of these were in my control. It's not like I bailed because I just didn't want to go."

Before that relationship was officially over, she jumped into a relationship with a disaster of a guy named Arrron. Employment insurance user, jobless, homeless, carless has a wife he's not divorced from, kids are unhappy etc... ....it was a pretty bad abusive relationship that lasted a year and half before she realized he had to go and cut him. Of course I'm overwhelmed with joy because I knew he was a gross cheater / user who was hurting her. I l live across Canada, three provinces away for added context, so I couldn't see a lot of the trauma she was going through from Aaron. But I digress. 

A couple weeks go by and she hits the town newly single and meets a guy outside a bar named James. She tells me about him over text and she's super excited about him but she's super aware that he's not relationship material and it's only for ""fun"" and she also casually drops ""he does A LOT of cocaine"".

It's been about two months since she's met this guy and it isn't just for ""fun"" anymore. Clearly. She said she caught feelings a week into sleeping with him and laughed about how it's going to be trouble? She spends her free time with him (two weeks out of the month, since shes co parenting 50/50 with BD) so I know he's going to be around. 

I am about to relocate across Canada back to my home town, where my BFF is living. I feel deep down in my core I do not want to meet this guy, see him, talk to him.

I feel like an asshole for not wanting to meet the guy she's spending her time with and she wants me to meet. I would rather eat dirt than be near a cocaine addict but I love and adore my friend and want to always be supportive. She needs to take space and time to be alone and heal from her past relationships and what she's gone through and she keeps jumping from one branch to another and it's WIDLY unhealthy and I don't want to be a part of it.

i have this problem with my older sister that everytime a school event comes up, we get into fights about it- a few years ago it was for hoco, this time for prom. last time at hoco, she and my mom got upset at me for wanting to buy my own dress instead of using the ones we have at home.  the ones at home that i tried on were mainly all hand me downs from my older sister, and keep in mind shes about 7 years older than me. many of the dresses were not my style/didn't feel flattering on me. therefore, i wanted to buy my own. at this time i didn't have a job, so i guess it was more understandable for them to be upset at me buying a new dress for a one time dance. however, i thought the dresses i was looking for were all affordable. we don't come from a extremely wealthy family but we are FAR from poor. my sister called me a spoiled brat for this.

this time for prom, i now have a job and am able to buy my own clothes. i asked my sister what she thought about me buying certain heels and she got upset, saying that i ""just like spending money"" and i could use her old heels at home. the problem is that i don't think any of the heels at home would match with my dress. i also want to form my own identity, my style is very different from hers.

am i wrong for this, or too irresponsible with my money?"
391,1jt9pqn,Asshole,AITA for asking my girlfriend to pay for her own engagement ring?,"So I (24M) have been with my gf (25F) for 3 years. We are living together and very in love. We’ve discussed marriage before and are on the same page about it. I’d like to propose to her because there’s no reason to wait when we both know we want to marry each other. The problem is I really don’t have a lot of money and my gf has a good salary. I brought this up to her the other day and said that I know she has more in her bank account than I do for now but we’ll eventually have a joint bank account. Since our money will be shared anyway, I asked if she would pay for her engagement ring. I thought this made a lot of sense and wouldn’t be a problem. I was wrong. My gf seemed really offended by this and said that she wouldn’t fully buy her own ring. I don’t get this, it’s going to all be OUR money anyway, so why should it matter who pays for the ring? She’s been kind of distant with me and I’m wondering if my request was really so wrong. AITA?

EDIT:
Wow, I see everyone thinks I’m a gold digger after my gf’s money? That’s ridiculous, I love her for who she is, not her money. I’m in between jobs right now and really can’t afford the ring but we’d both like to get engaged as soon as possible and she deserves something nice. I don’t see why saying the money will be ours anyway is so bad, because it WILL. My money will be hers, too in our future joint bank account. "
392,1jt9ifz,Asshole,AITA for playing volleyball in the day of my sister's wedding?,"I’m (18F) in my school’s volleyball team and we had a match scheduled for the day of my sister’s (24F) wedding. The game was early in the morning, the wedding would be at night, so there would be no conflict.

Anyway, some relatives of ours who were in town just for the wedding heard me talking about the match and chose to go. It was their own decision, I only mentioned the game but didn’t invite anybody personally. After the game, I come home. My team had won, I was excited, and some of our relatives were asking me about the team, and whether I plan to continue on playing when I’m in college etc.

My sister was already there – she chose our parents’ place as her HQ – and I could instantly tell she looked upset. When we were alone, I asked her what was the problem (I thought something was wrong with the wedding planning at first), and she went out on me about how this was supposed to be her day and I made it all about me when I chose to play and when I told our family about it.

I told her I can’t control other people’s reaction and that I didn’t insist for anyone to come, but she was still upset. We couldn't continue the conversation because she was about to get her hair and makeup done. We get to her wedding and of course she had other things on her mind. But after the ceremony, I went to hug her and her husband during the party, and I told her a brief ‘I still want to talk to you about today’, but she just said ‘Now it’s not the time’. And that’s where we are now, we didn’t talk any further. AITA?"
393,1jt8u5o,No A-holes here,AITA for not getting my mom cigarettes?,"Made a throwaway just for this post

Both my parents have been heavy smokers since the dawn of time it seems like. They knew the risks just like everyone else. As me and my older sister became adults they would ask us to either go out and get them cigarettes or ask us to grab them on the way home if we were out and about. They have always told us that they would quit but they just couldn’t shake the addiction like many others. In late 2024 my dad was sent to the hospital. He had a small stroke and the doctor told us one of the biggest factors was his heavy smoking. From that day forward I refused to get cigarettes for my parents because I would feel guilty and if they were to die from this I didn’t want to be responsible. Cut to April 4th, 2025. My dad passed away. He fell very very ill starting on march 31st. The two big factors to him being severely ill were an infection in his blood stream that went into his heart and brain, and his heavy smoking. Anyways, today me and my friends and my little sister went to go see the Minecraft Movie to distract ourselves. After the movie we head to McDonald’s to get the MC Movie Meal when I receive a text from my Mom asking if we can pick her up cigarettes. I tell her that I love her so much but I feel too uncomfortable getting her cigarettes, especially due to what just happened 2 days before. She responds “Well, okay. Thanks.” I instantly felt like I was the asshole. My older sister thinks I’m the asshole too which is weird because not even a month earlier we discussed not buying our parents cigarettes anymore and we were on the same page. Am I the asshole? Should I have just gotten my mom the cigarettes even though I am very uncomfortable with doing so? 

I want to also add, they had 2 vehicles that they could have used to go and get the cigarettes themselves. We were ~30 min away from home. They are not even 5 minutes from the closest gas station "
394,1jt8t6i,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to take care of my ex’s dog even though I was the one who originally adopted him?,"Using a throwaway because some people I know follow my main.

I (28M) adopted a dog, Max, five years ago when I was living with my ex, “Riley” (30F). We were together for a little over three years. Technically I adopted him, I filled out the paperwork, I paid the adoption fees and the vet stuff in the beginning, but Riley was always way more attached. She did the training, took him on walks, taught him tricks, all that. She really bonded with him. I loved him too, but I honestly think he loved her more.

When we broke up two years ago, she asked if she could keep Max. It sucked but I said okay. I remember saying something like, “I just want him to be happy.” She cried, I cried, it was a whole emotional thing. I moved out and she kept him.

Fast forward to last week. She calls me out of nowhere saying she’s been struggling. Mental health stuff, work’s a mess, she might lose her place. She said she needs a break from being a dog owner and asked if I could “take Max back for a while.” She made it sound temporary but also kind of vague.

I told her I can’t. I live in a small apartment with a roommate who’s allergic, I work like 60 hours a week, and I honestly don’t have the space or energy to take care of a dog again. Especially not this dog that I already emotionally said goodbye to.

She got really upset. Said I’m abandoning him, that I “don’t even care what happens to him,” and that if I don’t take him she doesn’t know what she’s going to do. Her mom even called me, which was... weird.

Now I feel like shit. My friends are split. Some say it’s not my responsibility anymore, that I gave him to her and she made her choices. Others are saying I owe it to Max because I was the one who brought him into this in the first place and he didn’t ask to be caught between us.

I don’t know. I feel guilty but also like I’m being manipulated. I know this isn't really the place, but any advice would be appreciated. I don't know what to do :("
395,1jt7ogm,Asshole,AITA for not buying my stepdaughter a new car after she's repeatedly gotten into accidents?,"My step daughter is not a good driver. She was not a good driver when she was a teen and certainly not as an adult. When she was first learning to drive, she did very fast hard breaks, she repeatedly left her car's lights on or left her car unlocked.

When she first got her permit at 16, we gave her two rules. We would help buy her first car but she'd be on her own for car insurance, gas, and up keep. If she wanted a car, she needed to be the sole caretaker of it and it was on her to ensure she was taking good care of it. Her brothers had the same rules.

3 months into her being 17, she got in her first accident. It was her first time driving in the ice and she slid. Her car hit another car. It was not a serious accident, but it caused roughly 1k in damages. Her car drove for another 2 months, but the transmission went out eventually. She bought it at 160-ishk miles so none of us were surprised it didn't last very long.

When she was 19, she was in another car accident. While on the highway, a semi-truck tried to merge wile riding next to her, she sped up and during it, another car tried to merge right as she sped up. The car was totaled. Outside of wiplash and minor wrist injuries, she was okay. Because of this accident, we made her get her own insurance because our payment went up.

Three weeks ago, she was involved in another accident. Again on the highway, she was passing an on ramp and a car coming on hydroplanned and lost control of a ladder in the back of it's pick up truck. It again totaled her car: it could not leave the scene and we had to get her to bring her back to her college. The other driver broke his collarbone and she has wiplash, a shoulder injury, and some facial damage that should heal in the next bit. The police officer told her that it was not her fault, but obviously we have to wait for the insurance to make that call.

Once she got home from the ER, she asked for us to help her purchase a new car. She said that it's not practical for her to constantly walk everywhere until she could afford a new car. She makes $21 an hour as a CMA at a nursing home so it won't take her long to buy a cheap car. From her apartment, she is about 1.5 miles from college, .25 miles from a grocery store, and 4 miles from her job. I think for the time being, she can walk, ask for rides from friends, or use an app. We don't have public transportation, but lots of side walks. She can walk the entirety from her apartment to class, most to a store, and on and off from her job.

My husband wants us to purchase a new car and have her pay us back. I don't think this is the right move. To date, the only time we have ever helped buy a car is when they all started driving, and we only paid half. She only saved 2k for her first car, so we only gave 4k for a new car. One of her brothers saved up 10k, so we gave 10k. If we start doing this now, we will walk down a very expensive walk.

I have gotten mixed reactions from others.

Thoughts? Am I the asshole?"
396,1jt74ox,Not the A-hole,AITA for how I explained to SIL that she wouldn't be my son's godmother?,"My wife and I aren’t practicing Catholics per se but we do follow certain traditions such as christening ceremonies for our children. Some people choose a married couple to be godparents; when I was a baby, my parents chose my uncle and his then-wife, and they divorced when I was still a child and I lost all contact with my former-aunt and basically grew up ‘without’ a godmother.

So my wife and I always thought it was best to choose one of our relatives, and one from each side of our family. For our second son, I chose my brother as godfather, and my wife chose a cousin of hers as godmother. When I called my brother to invite him, he assumed I was asking both him and his wife, and there was this awkward moment when I had to explain to him my SIL wouldn’t be the godmother. He seemed fine with it, but my SIL didn’t attend the ceremony and my brother later told me she was a bit upset.

So I called her later that day just so there wouldn’t be any ill feelings, and I briefly explained our reasoning, including my own personal history with my uncle's divorce. And then she got really mad, as if I was implying I believe she and my brother will get divorced down the road, which was not my point AT ALL. She also said just as couples might get divorced, anyone can also lose touch with a blood-relative, which is objectively truth, but again, not the point we were making here. 

I’m sad that what was supposed to be this happy family moment is now tainted somehow."
397,1jt740k,Not the A-hole,AITAH for laughing at jokes a friend of my bf made?,"
I (27F) recently organised a birthday dinner for my boyfriend (38M). I invited his closest friends (some of them he even calls “brothers”). 
For context: I’m a high functioning autistic person, and -you guessed it- I struggle with social interaction; my bf told me several times to laugh more, be more open, interact more with people. 
So this evening, after two very intense days of working, cooking, getting the house ready etc, I was trying to enjoy the dinner and to be social. 
Mind you: my bf was watching a soccer match the whole time, and was nervous bc he was losing money with bets, so it was a bit awkward and I kinda felt like I had to entertain the ppl there.
So one of his friends started joking about my bf being a bit of a hypochondriac. He told a story about him measuring his temperature three times in a single evening. I laughed and added that he asked me once if his temperature of 97° could be a bad sign and if I thought it was going to rise. 
Later on this friend made other comments about this topic, but I didn’t add anything. I kinda smiled and laughed along, more because of a nervous thing. I really felt the pressure of keeping everyone entertained. 
At one point I told my bf, who was worried about his  upcoming blood tests, that it would be great if he did a some sort of workout, given he has a mild heart condition too. But I said it in a nice way, I’m really concerned about him and his mental/physical health.
That’s all that happened.
When the guests went home, he snapped at me and told me I ruined the evening by being too open and laughing too much at stupid jokes. 
He said I hurt his feelings and that I should have ignored his friend.
I couldn’t believe it, and replied that he could have been more present instead of watching the game and insulting God in front of everybody because of his stupid bets.
I feel so stupid, I worked hard to cook for everyone, made a really nice cake he didn’t even eat.. 
I really struggle at social gatherings, especially if I’m the host.. so help me out, am I the asshole?

398,1jt6rbm,No A-holes here,WIBTA for going on abroad when my uncle is in the hospital?,"I (23M) am in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend (21F). I live in the US, she lives in the UK. We have known each other for 5 years, but have only been ""official"" (as official as you can be in an internet relationship) for the last 18 months. This vacation has been booked and paid for for about a month now, and it is more or less entirely non-refundable. My girlfriend's father paid for my flights to the UK as he wants us to meet and he knows that my financial situation is not great at the moment. (I fully intend to repay him when I have the money.)

My uncle has been diagnosed with brain cancer for a long time now, but recently he has gone downhill and is currently in hospice care. Even before he was seriously sick, my family have been finding ways to stop me from going to visit my girlfriend. My mother (who I'm not very close with - I live with my grandparents) withheld my birth certificate from me to stop me from getting a passport, so I had to pay for a new birth certificate and my passport behind her back and out of my own pocket. I have already paid a lot of money for that, my girlfriend has paid for the hotel we will be staying in when I visit, and her father has paid a lot for my flights. 

The main problem is that the trip is in one week, but my uncle has only been given 2 weeks or so to live. I have visited him and will continue to do so until I go to the UK. I love my uncle so much, and fully intend on seeing him as much as I can and obviously want to go to his funeral. However, my family are refusing to allow me to go to the funeral *and* on my trip. My uncle hasn't passed yet, but they are already accusing me of missing his funeral on purpose and they have continuously berated me for ""not caring about him."" This obviously hurts as I love my uncle, but this trip is very important to my life too. My grandparents are fully capable of planning the funeral for when I return so I can attend, which I obviously want to, but they are implying that they will purposefully plan it so I miss it. My grandfather specifically said that it'll make me ""feel guilty for the rest of \[my\] life.""

I'm obviously stuck in a tight situation, and I really don't know how to feel. I feel very guilty for whichever decision I make. I have cost myself, my girlfriend, and her father around $1000 total for this trip which will be completely wasted if I don't go. But, if I do go, my family might make sure I miss my uncle's funeral and I'll feel incredibly guilty.

Am I the asshole for even still considering this vacation? Or are my family in the wrong for putting me in this scenario? I really don't know how to feel or what to do. I love my uncle but I also don't want to put my relationship on hold for at least another year."
399,1jt6c6j,Asshole,AITA [35M] for getting on my brother [27M] about not driving?,"My brother and I live with our parents. My brother didn't learn how to drive as a teenager due to driving anxiety. My brother has an extensive history of anxiety and depression. He did manage to get his license when he was 22 due to numerous professional driving lessons. He's had his license for 5 years. He's driven here and there. His driving is not that bad, but he needs to do it more often to get better and experienced. I believe he lacks confidence. He has stated that he didn't like when our dad tried to teach him due to being overly critical and impatient and it didn't help his anxiety. I always ask him if he wants to drive and he refuses. I'm like what was the point of getting your driver's license if you're not going to drive? He said he'll get back into driving soon. He catches the bus to work and uses Uber sometimes to get around. 

I'm annoyed because it puts a burden on all of us. It would be nice if he could drive to help out more. Our mom oftentimes will ask me or our dad to play her lottery or get her something from the store. Sometimes I don't feel like doing it and it would be nice if my brother could do it sometimes. It's annoying always having to be the designated driver. I keep telling my brother, ""You need to start driving."" Every time I say it he gets visibly annoyed. I feel like he needs to hear it.

401,1jt686d,Not the A-hole,AITA for having a guy friend?,"Hey so this is a small part to a bigger picture. 
So I (female 16) and this guy I’ll call B is (male 17). I will give you guys just a little background We talked in the spring of last year and dated different people over the summer but after she broke up him, he came crawling back. And we ended up talking for a month and he actually ended up being my first kiss. But HE ended things but then he keeps coming back. And in November we agreed to just mess around. And we went no contact and he came back and now we are no contact again. So we are nothing right now, but it’s getting really bad now.

Okay now my problem… 
I have this friend (male 16) let’s call him H and me and H used to talk but it was in between 7th grade and 8th grade so it’s been a couple of years. But there is no feelings at all! I mean people tease us but there are no feelings at all. But B keeps staring at me and glaring at H and he knows that we talked a couple of years ago. It’s gotten to a point that when B leaves school early he takes the long way to avoid seeing me with H. And it’s making H uncomfortable. I have brought this up to my friends and they all say I’m being petty and that he has the right to look at whoever he wants. But that’s not my problem my problem is that when im with H he glares and whenever I’m not with H, B glares. 

So AITA for having this guy friend?"
402,1jt67yi,Not the A-hole,AITA because I (20F) don’t want to hangout with my friends (19F) boyfriend?,"To make this as short and sweet as possible. Me and some coworkers wanted to hangout on Monday. My friend said that was fine, but she’d have to sit in the back with her boyfriend rather than the front with me. When I was dropping hints that I didn’t want her boyfriend to come, she said she was going to be sleeping over at his house- presumably why she wanted him to come. I explained that I wanted to have a girls day without him and that we could reschedule if anything. She said ‘I should’ve just said so.’ 

Today, I asked the group chat between her and our coworkers about where we were going to eat tomorrow (Monday). She then suddenly told me she doesn’t know if she’ll be able to come. Upon asking why, she said ‘ik you remember I had plans.’ I simply responded that I thought she was available Monday. She said ‘for a girls day idk tho.’ So I asked; wdym? like you won’t go unless your bf goes?’ she responded: girl do you have memory loss? It was giving attitude at this point- so I said ‘i’m just asking you what you mean. you said you were sleeping over with him that’s all I remember you saying.’ she then said: ‘no memory needed, look at the messages.’ I was honestly rather peeved now so I responded:

I checked the messages, you just said you were going to his house and sleeping over. Originally you were available, but after I said I didn’t want your boyfriend to go you magically have plans. I’m not sure where the attitude is coming from, or how it’s deserved, but I’m just trying to figure out if you’re coming or not. If you’re not, fine. If you are, fine. 

Hours later, she said: 

the plans were to go to his house in the morning because i have plans with his family in the morning…thats why the 4 oclock hangout was good for us so now that he cant go yeah idk if i can go (which she hadn’t said all of that before- she only told me about a sleepover) and now i dont wanna go cause youre making it seem like i dont wanna go cause hes not going and catching an attitude. so frankly count me tf out.

I don’t understand what I did wrong. I was catching attitude from her, so I responded accordingly. Am I the asshole?

403,1jt608u,Asshole,AITA for complaining to my lab TA?,"AITA or in the wrong for this? Had a lab for one of my electrical engineering classes, theres one every week, and I had to miss last week to celebrate Eid. I let him know that I couldn’t make it and why and he said no problem. I felt bad because I had left him to do the whole lab himself which takes several hours but it turns out he wrote and submitted the full post lab report without mentioning it to me and did not include my name on the report. He also added a note saying I didn’t show up. I sent an email to my TA to complain that even though I didn’t show up I had let him know beforehand and assumed that we would finish the lab report together. (Poor assumption on my end). I’d rather not confront my partner regarding this to maintain a professional work environment but I also don’t believe I deserve a 0 given I had a valid excuse. Note that I did not notify my lab TA beforehand because attendance is not mandatory for lab as long as someone shows up to gather the data."
404,1jt4vcj,Everyone Sucks,AITA for not making a sad time a happy time?,"Today we picked up our cat's ashes and it's not been a positive experience. Right now my wife B (40f) and I (K 44m) are not talking, and I've been told I've ruined everything about today.

Background: 1 week ago (a Saturday) we helped our cat M (18f) across the rainbow bridge (euthanized her) after a long battle with arthritis and benign tumors. She was my buddy. Always there to get treats, always curled up in my lap when it was available, tucked in with me at bedtime, on my back or chest when it was time to get up. But she was my wife's cat, a kitten she got before we were married but became my sidekick even when we were dating.

M, B, and I had a great morning together, made her comfy, a service came over to help her cross at our house. They took M to be cremated, we spent the day together on the couch. We had M's fav human food in her honor, did a cheers to her. I don't handle loss well, at all. And after 16 years, it feels like we've lost a child. I started packing away emotions so B and son G (3m) didn't see me crying every hour. Next day was explaining to G where M went. By Friday we were all joking and laughing again. When G would ask about M, it didn't hurt to talk about.

Told Saturday we were holding a service for M at the facility. Told B I wasn't comfortable revisiting feelings, and just wanted to pick up M. B said it would be fun. I tried to be a good sport but constantly cramming down the feelings made me chippy and snappy. Everything started to become an argument. Sunday at our appointment I started crying the minute I saw M's urn. We had to write a letter to her, put M's name on their wall of memories. It was just too much for me. It felt like I was holding her again as she quit purring. Then B wanted to get lunch. Fully expecting delivery or drive-thru pick up, I agreed. It was a brunch place. I didn't want to cry in public. I said I wanted to go home. B got mad, and stormed off. Pulling into the driveway I cried because it felt like bringing M home from her monthly vet appointments for arthritis medication, only this was her last trip home. B took G and walked inside leaving me in the car.

We picked up the house, stayed busy, avoided each other, had cordial exchanges about what needed done. G went down for his nap. We were alone, and I tried to explain to B I wasn't mad, but sad. My attitude over the past 2 days was me coping. She said ""OK, sorry I put you through that"" and walked off. Hour later I apologized for making her upset, said I don't know how to fix things and that for a while now it feels like I'm always hurting her feelings. She yelled ""REALLY!? NOW!? You want to talk about 'your' feelings now? GOD! Today was supposed to be fun, I was excited to bring M home. But NO you have to ruin the whole weekend. It's always 'your' feelings. What the fuck!? God dammit!!!"" Haven't spoke since today. AITA?

405,1jt4kef,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting to give my mom money?,"I (18F) don't want to give my mom (45) money. My father is a 2 tour iraq veteran who served the country for 13 years. With his benefits as a veteran I will recieve education benefit checks monthly of around $1500 for going to college. I will be staying at home as a commuter because I wanted to see my younger siblings grow up a little bit more before I take off and go on with my own life, plus my mom said I'd have a support system here since I'm just starting adulthood.

With me staying home and commuting to university, my mom says that those $1500 checks would be going to her as ""room and board."" This really rubs me the wrong way.

I do a lot at home. I cook, clean, bathe my 3 year old brother, watch, pick up, homework and I am overall like another parent in the household. She even says now that I'm older she's only going to be a partial parent and ""jokes"" about me going to parent/teacher meetings in place of her since she's getting too old.

Don't get me wrong I wouldn't be where I am today without her. My biological mom passed in a car accident when I was 7-8 months old so by the time I was almost 3 my dad marries my NOW mom and she adopts me. Without her I genuinely would be in a trailor park somewhere doing nothing with my life. I genuinely love my mom with all my heart but this whole check thing is just baffling to me.

I told her that since she wants the check so bad then that should cover everything, ie. I'm doing the bare minimum aside from cleaning of what I may cause especially since I'll be sharing a room with my 14 yo sister for the next 3 years. Additionally, I told her that I will also be doing what I want when I want as long as it's not late at night. Throughout, middle & highschool my mom did not allow me to hang out with friends and go to one anothers house, I essentially only saw and hung out with my family. She is even picking out a preschool near my university so I can drop off and pick up my brother.

On top of it, my parents make around 110k a year from the government and they don't have jobs, they're home all the time and she mostly stays home, workouts, shops, and cooks dinner when I don't. It's disheartening to know that she wants me to give her the whole check while I'll be working a job in college on a pre-med track. I just want to live my life and not have to be a parent to my siblings and constantly be around my family, I think I've deserved a break.

So, AITA for not wanting to give her the WHOLE check?

But when I came home, my mother accused me of lying about it because I didn't explicitly state, without even being asked or knowing it was an issue for her, that Mark would be present at the play. As I stated before, she seems to really like him and thinks he is very nice and a good friend. There was no reason at all for me to think that she would have an issue with both of us being there together, as he has as much of a right to be there as I do and as of now, we aren't in a relationship. I knew he was going weeks in advance, but nobody ever asked who else would be there, only who I personally was going with, and I did not intend to go with him. We do go to school together. She thinks that I purposefully ""lied by omission"". I cannot see her perspective no matter how hard I try to. She is genuinely hurt and believes I have lied to her and she can no longer trust me. Am I really in the wrong for not stating that Mark would be there when I didn't have a reason to? She has never had an issue with him in the past.

407,1jt47m8,Asshole,AITA for how I responded to my friend’s mom asking for more money after I already paid what she had said I owed her?,"Basically, our agreement was I paid split rent, including utilities for half a bedroom I shared with my friend I left halfway through the end of the month and gave her the money that she said I owed her, which was a total of 280 and assume that was that and haven’t contacted them since until today here’s what went down 

The mom: ""Morning, I have already paid the electric bill and still owe the water bill. Utilities are paid one month behind. I am extremely broke and cannot afford to pay the water bill or by groceries or I wouldn't ask. Can you please pay your split of the utilities for last month and this is half of what is owed for the room of $87?
My friend would owe the other $87 and her aunt would owe $174 same for me.""

My reply:
""No, I wasn't even there for a majority, I'm not giving y'all any more money. I'm broke too. and what happened to the 280 l already gave you wasn't that the split I already owed where is this other money coming.from? I would love to help you, but I have nothing left to give.""

The Mom:
""figured that would be your reply. Bills for last month are due this month. That's fine good to know what type of person you are No worries tho""

My reply:
""Look, I wasn't even there majority of the time I barely even used utilities. I'm not giving you anything. I don't give a fuck what kind of person you think I am y'all aren't my problem anymore.""

The Mom:
""True but none the less you showered ate food and used internet but I didn't ask you to replace that. Really it's fine karma works its best in situations like this I'll figure it out""

My reply:
""And I pay for the Internet you told me all I had to pay left was 280. I did that and now I'm gone so don't be asking me for more money that's crazy pushing all this karma shit ""we see what kind of people you are."" Like okay quit texting me. And who do you think you are to be asking for help and then insulting me when I decline?
Why don't you think about that when you wanna talk about what kind of person are""

Tldr: was with a friend paying rent I left gave the rest of the money that I I was told I owed and now she's telling me I owe her more and I sort of called her out for guilt tripping me. Am I the asshole for not giving her money were my responses inappropriate?

Edit: I would like to mention groceries were split between household members, so we all shared 
Also the remainder payment that I mentioned was the total she gave me after I had completely moved out not while I was still living there"
408,1jt3qvj,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for kicking my sibling out for not doing chores,"I (21m) let my sibling (18nb) who I will call J move in with me and my fiancé (18m) who I will call V. When J moved in I offered to give them a month to get on their feet before expecting them to chip in towards rent. During that time V and I gave them a small list of chores around the house which they did and everyone was getting along despite the abrupt change. Both J and V enjoy alone time so it was an adjustment. Pretty soon however J spent more time on the Xbox and less time helping with the chores or flat not doing them. I have had multiple conversations with J about doing chores or offering to help with finding a job, yet J continues to put in minimal effort towards around the house or finding a job. I would like to note  that V is blind and the list of chores we gave J are ones V has a harder time doing himself. While I help out on the weekends my job keeps me away most of the week days with no consistent schedule. It has now been almost 2 months and they have not found a job yet or put in money towards rent. While going back to live with our parents is not the best option I am not sure how else to help someone who will not accept the help offered. Note if J finds a job they will not be required to do as many chores and V and I have said as much.

WIBTA for telling J to do this list of chores which finding a job was added to or I will kick them out?

List of chores: 
- dust/wipe surfaces
- sweep
-Vacuum
-Wash dishes (V puts them away)
-Clean litter box when necessary 
-Make dinner Saturday (we pay for these groceries as well)
-Look around for jobs and put in applications"
409,1jt2wr0,Not the A-hole,AITA for not checking on a friend when she went MIA?,"for context, we’re both in college. it was spring break and we went on a road trip with a few other friends. this one girl initially did not want to come due to poor financial situation and family issues but after talking with her parents, she was able to tag along. there were also a few occasions on that trip that suggests she was close to crashing out. i may have contributed to it since she literally ignored me for half a day for no apparent reason. anyway, we came back to rest over the weekend before school resumed, and she deactivated her instagram account (our main platform of communication). i do have her number and location too but i never texted her back. my thought process was **oh, she’s pissed at me even though idk why since she went MIA and disabled sharing her location with me.** so to not fuel the fire, i just kept to myself. i think its also pretty clear to the friend group that im not good with feelings and emotions in general - like i dont even acknowledge my own. when school resumed, i would almost always bump into her during lunch on most days but i never saw her once that whole week even though she was on campus. makes me think she’s still avoiding me intentionally.

i went to talk to a mutual and i found out that she was disappointed at me because i did not reach out to her when she went MIA. im supposedly the “closest” to her within the friend group and while others did text her to check in on her, i did not. and thats why she’s upset about me. so AITA for not checking in on her even when she was struggling with mental health (what they claimed) even though i had a reasonable suspicion that prevented me from doing so (in bold above)?

(tbh, even if i knew she wasnt upset about me and went MIA, i probably wouldnt have reached out anyway just cause im that kind of person. i hate talking about emotions and feelings and struggle with it a lot. i dont think i have ever reached out to anyone over text when they are crashing out, but maybe i would if its in person idk)"
410,1jt1rjd,Not the A-hole,AITA for not being able to to do the most I could at a certain time?,"I (17M) have been with my girlfriend (16F) for almost a year. Recently, I’ve been dealing with a lot. During Ramadan, I stayed at my aunt’s place for two weeks because my mom (42F) was hospitalized. She has an autoimmune disease and underwent her 12th surgery, a full hysterectomy due to tumors. Thankfully, she pulled through.

Staying with my aunt and uncle, who raised me, was tough. My uncle is battling alcoholism, and my aunt is overwhelmed with work. Their kids were being neglected, so I stepped in to care for them. It was emotionally draining, and I often cried myself to sleep.

All this took a toll on my mental health, and I became depressed. I didn’t realize I was neglecting my girlfriend until she pointed it out. I apologized, explained my situation, and promised to do better, even though I’m still not fully okay.

Recently, feeling a bit better, I reached out to her to reconnect. She was distant, saying she preferred to watch TikTok. When I expressed my feelings, she said, “I’m now accustomed to you not giving me enough love and attention.” That hurt, especially since I’m trying to improve.

I reminded her of my struggles and efforts, but she responded, “It’s not always about your mental health.” This is confusing because she encouraged me to be open about my emotions.

Now, I feel blamed for both my initial distance and for expressing my feelings. AITA for feeling hurt by her reaction?"
411,1jt1okq,Asshole,AITA for lying to my family so I don’t have to help my sick grandmother?,"I (30F) was asked to help my grandma move from her old house into a 1 bedroom apartment in a senior community. She is in her 80s, not in great health, and her house is about to be condemned by the city because she didn’t take care of it over the decades. 

She’s also an asshole whom I haven’t spoken to in over a decade because she abused and neglected my father so bad that he now has severe mental and physical health conditions that are directly caused from her mistreatment of him during his childhood and adolescent years. 

Anyway, my mom asked me to help move my grandma and I vaguely agreed that I would show up this weekend to help out. The only reason I said yes is because it was my mom that was asking. 

HOWEVER, I have just now flat out lied to my mom feigning a “pet emergency” so I don’t have to travel and help move my grandma in. 

I am scared that I made the wrong choice and was just being selfish because I didn’t want to involve myself with that side of the family. Even still, she’s still an old lady who needs help. 

Am I the asshole for refusing to help and lying to my mom about it? 

My mom and I have talked in depth over the years about why I don’t involve myself in family matters. My mom knew that I don’t like my grandma and rightfully so. Even SHE doesn’t like the woman. My mom has told me stories about how my grandma told my dad to leave my mom while she was pregnant with me. My grandmother was also not shy about showing me how much she disliked me because I was simply my mother’s daughter. 

My mom got mad and told me to just stay home and don’t bother trying. And I agreed. I felt great in the moment but now I’m just sitting at home relaxing into my sofa with nothing to do but feel guilty. 

This is why I don’t involve myself with family affairs. I have enough issues on my own. 

AITA?"
412,1jt199q,Not the A-hole,AITA for confronting my s/o,"i’ve never done one of these but for background me and my s/o have been friends since like .. birth. we seperated a bit when we were younger but for a few years then remet. We lived together for a bit with another roomate but the place got too expensive so now we live in our own places. We’re chronically online so we’re always on twitter, we have privs and dprivs like any twitter-goer.We always hangout and a couple times i saw an icon on the side of her computer meaning she had a different account that i didn’t recognize, she said it was just for looking at art and didn’t let me see it. It happened twice a couple months apart and i didn’t think anything of it. 

We both share an online friend, and i suspected that online friend of having a crush on my s/o, but that was last year. I got kicked out of their privs because they got scared of me asking them about it but about a month ago i was let back in and we became friends again. when i got into his dpriv, i searched my name as i always do because im nosy. i found him mentioning my name to an account i didn’t know. It wasn’t anything bad, but casual conversation, but i didn’t know the other person and since the account was private i could see their responses or page.

I clicked on it and i realized it’s my s/o, and that friend was their only follower. When i asked her about it she said it was an account for venting and that she just let that friend in because he asked, they don’t talk much on there. But i know that’s a lie, because they interact on that account a lot. I went through all of the interactions like the little detective i am and found that friend calling themselves my s/os butch or whatever. saying they were butchfemme idk stuff like that. “I wish i could call ___ my femme” it actually pissed me off so bad. They both didn’t tell me about it. A while after i explained to my s/o why i didn’t like them both hiding it from me and i didn’t know if it was borderline emotional cheating but i don’t want to think about that i doubt she’d ever. 

She said she’d talk to the friend and when i asked to see the screenshots it just made me feel worse. She said she had to kick him out because she didn’t want to fight with me, and the friend was offering to just not reply and they were blaming themselves i know i shouldn’t be mad but damn this isnt about you. Oh i forgot to mention the reason i can’t be inside the account no matter what is because it’s too personal but i feel like if we’re going to be dating an online friend shouldn’t know more about you than me ? 

By the replies i can assume the account is for casual posting because she stopped posting much on her main priv, vents, and nsfw thoughts/art. We had a talk and she apologized and said she’d kick him out but i still feel really hurt. should i have not said anything? I feel like i caused a problem"
413,1jt12yu,Not the A-hole,AITA for cooking dinner for just myself?,"Hi there, 22F. Last summer I moved out of my parent’s house abroad and moved back to my country. Since last September I’ve lived with an old coworker of my dad and his wife. They’re in their late 50’s-60s.

Generally things are very pleasant and I’m truly grateful to stay here. Every month I pay them a set amount, and although I struggle at times between juggling self study and work, I try to keep things tidy and attempt to socialize with them by watching the news / movies together so I’m not just some ghost haunting the second floor lol. 

Most of the time his wife will cook dinner for the three of us, and I try to take up dinner duty sometimes too—though I struggle at times because they eat a lot less meat and salt + a lot more veggies than I do. It’s hard for me to come up with ideas because I’m so new at cooking and when I do cook I feel such an urge to have to make something that will impress them so I am nervous about messing it up.

I work in retail and this weekend I worked from Friday till Sunday (today). It’s been quite exhausting because of a big sale we’re having, so I’ve eaten by myself on Friday and on Saturday I did join them for dinner. Today I had to rush to get to work and they asked me what time I would get back. They told me that they’d be back a bit late because they’d be visiting family. I assumed that they did have plans for dinner, but we would probably just eat late then.

Today was a hectic solo shift for me and it’s also the first day of my period so I was really tired and sore and did not really have an appetite. I went to the store and got just a piece of salmon for myself + a tub of ben & jerry’s I’d leave for them because I don’t like ice cream like that for me to finish it all. I then texted them saying that when I got back I would sear it up for myself and my dad’s friend said that was fine. 

I was just finishing up cleaning when they came in and his wife kinda blew up on me that they would’ve liked to eat salmon for dinner as well. I was honestly a bit flustered because it was just one singular piece of salmon, no veggies or anything, and on top of that I made it with a soy sauce glaze that would have definitely contained too much salt for their diet. She then came with the counter that I could’ve just made a separate portion for myself with the glaze, but I was just being lazy, this was antisocial of me, and I also needed to learn to have more regard for others because she also could just choose to no longer cook for me as well.

Like yeah, I definitely could have made them dinner and I also would not have minded it at all, but it just genuinely slipped my mind. I also don’t know whether it’s hormones or not but I am a bit hurt by the comments and her assumptions that I did not make them dinner with specific intent. She generally does not get angry so I understand that for her to express her disappointment in this way—it was kind of dumb of me, but it also feels unfair and hurtful for her to say all of this?"
414,1jt0s1f,Not the A-hole,AITA for canceling my mom’s surprise farewell dinner because she called me messy?,"Hi Reddit,
English isn’t my first language, but I’ll try my best.

My mom (59F) and I (27F) have been “living together” for the past 10 months. I say “living together” because I’m only home 2–3 days a week—I usually stay at work or with my boyfriend.

She moved with me to Europe from Latin America. It was hard for her to adjust at first, but she’s active and has built a little community here. She’s retired and brought some savings to live and travel, and when she moved in, I started covering rent and bills. I’m lucky to have a good job and was okay with supporting her.

We don’t have the best relationship. I felt free for the first time when I moved out at 20. But I still wanted to be there for her.

We share my room (I have roommates), and she’s been living with me while we handled some long paperwork processes. Now she’s going back to our home country, so I planned a surprise Apericena (small dinner party) at a restaurant with family and friends.

The idea was to tell her we were going shopping so she wouldn’t suspect anything. I was getting ready and, to be fair, I can be messy when picking an outfit—I lay clothes everywhere. I eventually picked something, did my makeup, and suggested we leave early to take pictures at the park since the flowers are blooming.

Suddenly she said we couldn’t leave because I had to clean up. I told her I’d do it when we got back, but she insisted:
“You always say that and never do it. You’re arrogant and disrespectful. I can’t talk to you.”

I offered to clean right then, but she kept going, calling me stuck-up—maybe just because I was dressed nicely? It hurt. A lot. I started crying. It brought back bad memories from how she treated me growing up. I called my boyfriend and cousin because I was so upset.

Then I told her:
“You have no right to talk to me like that. I never disrespect you. That ‘stuck-up’ daughter of yours planned something really nice for you today. And now you’re making me feel ashamed when I’ve spent so much time and money.”

She responded: “I’m not going.”

I was furious. I canceled everything.
Fifteen minutes later, she came back and said, “Let’s go.”
But I was emotionally done. I told her, “No. It’s canceled,” and left to see my boyfriend.

It’s been a day. We’re not talking. I’ve gotten mixed opinions. Part of me feels guilty—this was supposed to be a good memory for both of us. But I also feel really hurt.

So… AITA for canceling the dinner?"
415,1jt05ka,Not enough info,AITA for being disappointed with my mum during a mental health crisis?,"My mum visited me in my new flat for the first time this weekend. At first it was nice. She told me the flat was pretty and we exchanged gifts.

I started to get stressed by the morning of the second day. My mum goes to sleep early and wakes up early. Due to severe insomnia, I can't. We slept in the same room and I just laid next to her quietly for 2 hours, trying to fall asleep. In the morning she woke me to ask me questions. No bad intentions, but waking up briefly, just to fall asleep again sends me straight into nightmares and a sleep that is hard to wake up from and leaves me exhausted.

By the time I got out of bed, I felt very tense and guilty. My mum had prepared breakfast, but unfortunately had taken out all my best porcelain and towels, and left one of them on the stove. It smelled burnt and I started crying when I saw the burnt towel and all the gifts and foods scattered around the kitchen.

We spent the day fixing a kitchen shelf. I took out the cleaning materials, a bucket of water. But my mum kept asking for more and different products and refused to do it the way I suggested. Instead of using the bucket, she kept using water straight from the tap, leaving it running, spraying dirty water everywhere, and putting the heaters in all my rooms on 5.

She asked me how she could help, but when i asked her to do specific tasks, she'd just get distracted and do something else halfway through. Or she'd refuse to do it (can't measure where to drill the new holes, because dyscalculia; can't operate a drill; etc). In the end she just sat in a chair with her phone, while I was doing the dirty work alone.

In the evening I showed her my paintings and she didn't say anything. Except for ""I'm tired and need to sleep."". I was sad about this and about the way the whole day went and cried. My mum demanded I tell her what's wrong. But I couldn't, because I knew we wouldn't have a constructive conversation. She said she didn't like my paintings and didn't see me having a future as a painter.

Somehow the next morning was better. We had a nice breakfast. Then some flowers tipped over and while I went to clean the mess, my mum videocalled the family. I hate being in video calls and hoped it would be over by the time I was done cleaning. But from the bathroom I heard her talking very loudly, giving my family a room-tour. She showed them everything and promised I'd host them too. I don't like being put on display like that. I hid in the bathroom until the call was over (30min).

After that I just melted. My mum threatened to go home early and told me I needed to check myself in to a psych ward. I tried explaining that I am already getting help and no amount of therapy on my side could replace her respecting boundaries and gaining a basic understanding of my way of being.

I cried the rest of the day, even while I took her for a walk, and for a ride to the train station. While I cried she just walked ahead silently, making occaisional remarks about the houses."
416,1jt00a7,Not the A-hole,AITA for not going to my grandma's 85th birthdaydinner probably 2 weeks to a month postpartum?,"So I (28 F) and my husband (33M) are expecting our first baby. With that I'm the first on my side of the family, so 1st grandkid and first great-grandchild, which is kinda special. 

Today my mom told me that, for my grandma's 85th birthday dinner, she wanted to look for a restaurant very close to my home (max 10 min. By car). My grandparents live over 1.5 hour away (I know its not far for most Americans, but where I live it is considered far away.) 

Now here is the deal. I'm expected to deliver my baby a month before the date of the birthdaydinner. But I dont know for sure when I will deliver. Especially with a first, I see a lot of people going 'till 41+ weeks. And in that case I wouldn't even be a month postpartum. 

I do not feel ready to go out at that time postpartum because I will still be adjusting to becoming a parent, my breastfeeding will still be very very frequent and maybe not going easy, and most importantly my baby will not be vaccinated yet and her immunesystem will not be on point yet.

I told my mom that it being close by is a very nice suggestion but also explained all the above and told her I don't think I'll be ready for that yet by the time the birthdaydinner will role around. I said that I hope that she'll understand and that the rest of the family will aswell and not be mad at me for setting that boundary (they have been notorious for complaining about stuff like having to drive a little further whilst normally I'd make the drive, f.e they haven't come to visit me yet, whilst I live in this house for 3 years, just because it's too far)

My mom thinks I'm being unreasonable because 'back in the day this was the norm' and 'she also did those things with me, and I turned out fine.' 

So am I being unreasonable? Am I the A**hole?"
417,1jsxmzb,Not the A-hole,WIBTA If I told this girl it's not my problem if she doesn't trusts her boyfriend,"I'm new to this school and well uh, I've been here two weeks. I sit with this guy, ""Ciel"" because there was where the teacher told me to seat and he has been very friendly, he invites me to seat with him and friends at lunch and talks to me and makes classes less boring. I could say we are friends. Now, he's got his girlfriend named ""Pepa"" and, she's exactly not happy about me being friend with Ciel. I've been told by Ciel once or twice that Pepa feels jealousy about me being with him and to please please please ignore her if she annoys me, I do so. And I some way became friends with Pepa but to be honest she was only my friend to be a second shadow behind me to see I wast gonna go with Ciel at breaks. This didn't annoy me much until Pepa with ""Alessia"" stopped me at a break to tell me to get a longer uniform skirt because mine was 'too short'. I said I wouldn't because I didn't had money to and because my skirt fitted just fine. They kept pushing so I turned back and walked away returning to mind my own business. I told Ciel about him and he, got annoyed as well. As a cherry on top of the cake, on the on the Anonymous Instagram Confessions group I got a message that said 'I was obviously in love with Ciel'. I've done nothing about it but I really really want to just go and tell Pepa that it isn't my problem if she doesn't trusts her boyfriend enough to have friendship with girls, but I don't want to have problems.

Would I be the A-Hole if I told Pepa that?


Edit: Today 07/04/25 Pepa broke up with Ciel without an specified reason, but claimed it was 100% Ciel's fault."
418,1jsxbch,Not the A-hole,AITA for blowing up at my husband after being late for son's camp?,"I (34F) have been married to my husband (37M) for 8 years and have 3 children (6,4, and 1). I had a cousins baby shower on the same weekend my son was going to an overnight camp. I knew it would be hard on my husband to get him to the camp with the three children so I arranged childcare for the youngest. I also got everything packed and put out for him for the camp. I left at 10am and the kids had ball hockey at 11:30-12:30 and then had to be at the camp for 6:30. The rest of the day he had nothing else to do. I asked him to give the kids a bath after ball hockey because they got muddy. At 3:30 I left the baby shower and let him know I would be back at 5:20 and to meet me at my parents at that time (closer to the camp location). At 5:15 I text him and he said the kids were still getting dressed so I instead had to get my mom to drive me back to the house. At this point it's already after 5:30 and the kids are just getting outside with soaking wet hair. He said he put the kids in the bath a long time ago but ""couldn't"" get them out. I exploded on him because how could he not get them out as the parent? On the way there, already late, I ask where his scout necker is (which was a requirement for identification) and he says he forgot it even though I set it out with all the stuff he was supposed to wear. He says he didn't know he wore one even though he takes him to scouts every week. Then we get there and he also forgot to bring my son's jacket or even a sweater (we are in Ontario and it's still cold here). I was so upset I didn't talk to him the whole way home. He says I'm an asshole for exploding on him and ruining our night. He says he does way more than most fathers. I am just sick and tired of having to manage everything. Planning and packing every single thing and he is still late and things get forgotten. I asked what he did all day and he said he ""cleaned"" and ""tried to install a light in my sons room"" but the light is sitting in the exact same spot as when I left and the house was a total mess when I got home so I'm not sure what he did that whole time. I'm just tired of everything falling on me and still things like this happening. So Reddit, AITA?

419,1jswfx0,Not the A-hole,AITA for trying to help my mother talk to her sister about an agreement they made that I was present?,"TLDR- My uncle was going to be homeless so my aunt came up with the idea that he would stay with us for six month and her for 6 months at a time alternating, he's been living with us for four years. 

So basically about four years ago, my uncle's wife died. She had throat cancer, and she died literally in his lap. They lived way far from the hospital. She was not going to make it to the hospital. The ambulance did not even make it in time upon that happening, he realized he would not be able to pay his rent And called my aunt to help so we drive three hours myself, my aunt and my mother so that all three of them can talk about it together my aunt, my mother and my uncle. My aunt then comes up with the idea that he can stay with us for six months and her for six months my mother is not OK with this at that point she is like my husband. This is gonna ruin my marriage. My husband is not gonna be OK with this like you've gotta go first and my aunt said no I have to talk to my husband first even though it's my idea. So he came home with us about six months later my baby daddy took custody from me using my uncle being at our home. That would be the first time we asked her to go ahead and take my uncle as she said she would she did not. It turned into a huge fight about a year later my mother and father began fighting really badly because of my uncle being at our home it got to the point where this year my father left for three months and upon asking my aunt for help we were told that it doesn't matter if my mom's marriage is failing because my dad's a piece of shit anyway and treat her like shit so why would they help us? This was not even said by my aunt. This was said by her daughter to my mother, and her daughter was not privy to the conversation and the agreement.
So yesterday, I said something to my aunt and my cousin decided to get shitty with everybody again I was very respectful. I was very kind until she said some bullshit so then we went to my aunt's house yesterday, and we were basically told that she changed her mind and isn't that OK and now we have to deal with it. We were also told that we're assholes and abusive for trying to get my aunt to hold up her end of the deal so basically are we the assholes? 

We could be the assholes for expecting my aunt to keep her word when she has shown she doesn't want to keep her word. "
420,1jsw2po,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking friend's to leave,"So for context I asked my so called friends to leave my house after staying over from friday-sunday Sunday afternoon I asked if they would be able to leave BC I had to clean and had to do a lot of things like plan to visit someone important to me that they have met and don't like.

421,1jsv2gd,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling a guy sitting next to me to stop snorting at a restaurant?,"I (45 female) recently was eating dinner with a good friend and former neighbor who moved away 6 months ago.  We had been there for approximately 20-25 minutes.  We were talking and laughing and being pretty quiet for a noisy restaurant since we both do a kind of “silent laugh” - one of the things we have in common.  We were just served when the man (older guy about 65 maybe) sitting at the table next to us had finished his meal. He was waiting for his check and looking at his cell phone.  When all of the sudden, he started making sucking noises (like my grandparents used to, to clean their teeth) and then he snorted. And it wasn’t just one snort, it was multiple and deep each time.  It literally echoed off the walls.
Now the first time, I let it go and didn’t say anything but had to fight gagging.  I happen to have an extremely sensitive gag reflex.  And sounds like that can get me started.  Meaning up to starting to vomit.  Not only that if I make my way to the bathroom it is like my brain says “ok let loose” and I always loose it.  So I stopped talking, turned my head and did breathing exercises to try to not go down that rabbit hole.  I just got “cleared” and we were chatting and eating again when he did it again. 🤢
So again the same process.  But this time I gave him a “look”.  Because I am not his mom and he is old enough to know manners (whether he knows them or not… well obviously not).  He clearly didn’t care or didn’t understand why I gave him an angry grin. 😠
Not too long after that he did it again! And if it happened a 4th time I would not make it to the bathroom.  And not only that he was ruining my meal.  So after getting myself through plugging my ears and humming I asked him to please stop snorting.  
He looked at me and said, “mind your own business little lady.  I am enjoying my meal like everyone else here.”  I replied with, “well if you do it again I will puke and make sure I do it on you.”
He looked really angry and I instantly felt like a teenager being a brat for that reply.  I almost said sorry when he got his check.  He signed it and left.
I had to take breaks because I had waves of feeling like I was going to start gagging.  I did make it through but almost lost it when I got outside on the walk to my car.
I was raised to be polite despite the situation and I normally am but I almost ruined dinner for everyone had I not been able to calm that reflex. That “little lady” comment had me seeing red!  Needless to say, not my most mature moment.  AITA for chastising him?  Or should I have tried to make it to the bathroom knowing I wouldn’t have made it?  
Edit:
1. I am aware of misophonia.  The volume of these snorts was quite literally reverberating off the walls, and my friend agreed it was way over the top and offensive for a restaurant.  So it’s not just me, and not misophonia.  The teeth sucking.. was more in line with an annoying noise.  
2. The request was calm and though I didn’t quote it, I was calm and polite and asked please.  
3. Several have posted “he could have health issues” to which if he had done it while he was eating, I would have just paid for my drinks and left!  Some people have “ticks” that they can’t help like clicking or Tourette’s.  This was not a “tick”.  It was after he was done eating and seemed to be part of a “post meal ritual” that I truly believe someone has point out to him in the past given his reply. 
4. I see that I was wrong in threatening to puke on him.  I was so irritated about the “little lady” comment. 🥺. Again not my finest moment.  But I shouldn’t have to leave because of someone else being so offensive and lacking etiquette that their actions are literally reverberating through the room.
5. I didn’t know if he had ordered dessert… so I didn’t know how long we all had to listen to this cacophony, when I asked him.  He hadn’t received the check yet.  
6. My gag reflex, though sensitive, has NEVER been challenged like this in a restaurant.  Never once.  So it’s not so sensitive that I shouldn’t expose myself to the possibility of noises in public.  I do have methods to calm it.  This was excessive and in all my life has never happened like this.

422,1jsuycz,Not the A-hole,AITA for letting my sister know about her mess?,"So I [26 F] decided to finally let my older sister [42 F] know of the mess she made. I usually don't because 1) I'm a people pleaser and a pussy. 2) I'd just excuse her because she has done so much for me and she has illnesses that flares up when she isn't careful. She'd sometimes leave used toilet tissue on the floor or in toilet, or she'd leave her hair in or all around the sink or on the floor. This has been a thing since I was a teen. She'd let me know if I made a mess to my face or by text and let me know that she cleaned up the mess. I do forget at times and she lets me knows every time it happens. But the first and only time I let her know I'm the buttface? There's a broom and a standing dust pan behind the bathroom door. She sometimes hauls literal trashbags of her things up and down the stairs whenever she goes shopping or stays over at a friend's or family's place but can't do a look around and quick clean up? We used to have our own bathrooms. A smaller one, used to be for guests, that she asked for  and I kept the bigger one, which all of 7 kids, excluding parents, shared till they moved out. I gave up mine because she'd leave a mess in it, and in both of the sinks too. She rarely cleans her own bathroom and my mom would either complain about that, her mini fridge full of old and new food she'd forget to check on, or the state of her room which feels like a storage unit.  
So I texted her and this is how it went:
Me: You left your hair on the ground./
Sister: what hair/
M: I already picked it up. I was just letting you know. /
Sis: I said where because I put all my hair in the trash can but ok/
M: On the restroom floor near the sink/
Sis: Ok girl obviously 🙄 it must of not been that much because I didn’t even notice it. My hair is shedding But ok /
M: Ok./

I've always done my hair in my room so I know for sure it wasn't me and my momma got grays.
I feel stupid for being mad at this but should I have just sucked it up, ⏸️ /j, and let it go? Am I doing too much? It was early in the morning and I thought she'd be asleep at that moment. Forgetting to check was understandable,  i can forgive that but this response irked me. Sorry for the girthy text, I love yapping. 

TLDR: My eldest womb twin basically lil bro'd me for making a deal about the little mess she left. Which in my mind feels years of little messes I've dealt with. 🧍🏾‍♀️

Edit: the layout looked confusing in post, some errors i made, and i added some sentences

423,1jst7gv,Not the A-hole,"WIBTA for excluding a family with a badly-behaved, autistic child from the neighborhood pool party?","I host a monthly pool party/bbq for the neighborhood families. I buy about $200 in steaks, hot dogs, and drinks, book the community party room, and send out invites and reminders. It's become a great way for the adults to connect and catch up, while the kids swim and play. 

One of the neighborhood boys doesn't behave appropriately - ie: splashes kids in the face when they ask him not to, pushes kids into the pool, calls them names, growls at kids if they win a game, doesn't follow the rules of games, and such. It's unpleasant for the other kids, and he makes the younger ones cry. His mom yells and threatens to take him home, but she doesn't, so he continues misbehaving. I'm not well-informed on autism, however, my stance is that the parents are responsible for ensuring their kids behave appropriately or removing them. Instead, other parents have to get involved to yell at the kid to leave theirs alone or comfort their crying kid.

After the last party, two of the kids asked me not to invite that boy again because he ruined the day for them. I agree with them and believe that as part of my responsibility of hosting is to create a guest list of people who add positively to the event.

My husband disagrees because 1) he thinks I should first bring up the issue to the boy's parents and give him one more chance, 2) we can't actually ""exclude"" them since it's a community pool, and 3) he's just conflict-avoidant and doesn't want to ruin relations with neighbors.

What do you think, would I be the asshole?

*Update:*
Thank you all for the advice - I decided to speak with the parents and tell them that I'm in a difficult position as the event host who wants to ensure my guests safety and enjoyment. I'll explain the impact on my guests when the mom didn't remove the misbehaving boy, and that I'm now hesitant to host another event. I'll listen to their response (hopefully apologetic and proactive) and go from there.

For those of you debating whether I can or can't ""ban"" the family from the community pool, that's not the point here: my question was about the etiquette around not inviting someone to a recurring event."
424,1jssz4f,Not the A-hole,AITA for “having attitude” with my family while on vacation when they constantly ignore my input and blame me when anything goes wrong.,"The title sounds silly ik. 

I 18M am on vacation in Europe with my family and the from the start it was a disaster. My dad asked me to make the itinerary but he literally changed the entire first half of it without even asking me. He’s paying for everything so I didn’t mind that but I did tell him that the places he added would be boring and it’s not his type of cities which he ofc ignored. My step mum deliberately avoided taking part in any planning even when I tried to involve her. Fast forward, the first half of it went exactly as I warned my dad it would go. He went to a seafood restaurant for lunch and got mad that it was only seafood they served. Yelled at the waiter at dinner cuz his linguini had muscles on it. The whole time he was saying it was my fault for suggesting this country and city and my step mum was complaining every step of the way. Through out the whole trip they would point at literally anything and ask me what it is or what it’s made of and would reply smugly if I I say didn’t know by saying something like (well you should know) On day 3 we went to a local market when my SM pointed at a jar of some kind of nuts and asked me what they were. I replied idk I didn’t make the food. She lost it and started yelling at me about respect in the middle of the marked at which point I walked away. Later my dad said I was at the wrong for having attitude and when I said how they both have been blaming me for everything, they said they were just joking. My SM jumped in and said that my dad’s paying for everything so I should just shut up and do what they say and not have attitude. 

I spoke with my mum about it and she just told me to just ignore them and enjoy it since it’s my birthday trip and since my dad depend around 20K on this trip that I should be grateful. AITA? "
425,1jsrg5b,Not the A-hole,AITA for not sharing my full travel itinerary with my ex and coparent?,"Background: To say my ex and I are contentious would be an understatement. He sends me slews of insults and I’ve taken to using chatgpt to scrub my messages of anything he can use to pick a fight. We have a 12 year old together. Months ago I let him know 12yo had a competition this weekend because I had to trade weekends for it. I am also the coach. Funny side story my child tried out for my team without me knowing until I showed up. The last time he talked to me about this competition he said “you just put 12yo on your team because you’re trying to compensate for being a shit mom.” So yeah contention. 

On to the story:

Comp is this weekend and last month it was moved to Exs town 4 hours away from us.  We take the bus up, stay in a hotel for 2 nights and head back Sunday. 

Against my better judgement I invited my ex to the competition despite the fact he was clear about how he feels. He wasn’t able to come because I didn’t give him enough notice but he didn’t insult me he just asked me to invite him earlier next time.  I apologized because I thought that was fair. I could have told him earlier that the location had changed. But honestly I avoid talking to him as much as possible. 

Yesterday he asked if he could meet us at the hotel. I explained that we are really only in the hotel to sleep and we’d be leaving at 8 am. I again apologized for the short notice and said I’d do better next time. 

He asked for our itinerary and I sent sundays travel schedule. 7am breakfast at the hotel. 8am we leave. There are some bathroom breaks on the schedule and a stop for lunch 2+hours away b it nothing that allows visiting. 

His response was to ask me why I didn’t share my itinerary with him when I invited him on Wednesday. 

I apologized again and said that since he said he couldn’t see 12yo this weekend I assumed it wasn’t relevant and since there is t really any extra time, I didn’t think it would matter. I left off that it’s my weekend and I’m not obligated to invite him and that he sees child regularly so it’s not like he can’t see 12yo until summer or something. Plus I’m trying to extend the olive branch here but to say he’s hostile would be an understatement. 

He pushed again asking why I hadn’t shared it. I simply apologized again because I’d already answered. 

“I expect you Do better next time.” Is what he said to me. 

I’m … I don’t know. Kind of feeling annoyed at how he’s acting entitled to my time after being so unbelievably rude to me (calling me a “shit mom” for involving child on my team) but also I could have shared it with him I guess. I just don’t see why I would. Besides the competition itself there’s not really any time in the schedule that isn’t spent with the team. 

Even my own husband who traveled down to watch has seen me for a total of 30 minutes during the competition. 

So AITA? Should I have shared the itinerary on Wednesday? 

Edit: we use our family wizard to communicate as our court ordered dictates. No. It has not helped in the least, except that I can (normally) ignore messages and download them once a month to save my sanity but that months worth of messages is filled with vitriol even with no input from me, so I’m just not sure how that’s supposed to help. 

Edit 2: I GOT IT GUYS. I shouldn’t have apologized. My brain was scrambled I’d walked 9 miles, supervising 10 middle schoolers for 13+ hours. I don’t normally engage at all. Like I said, he’d been civil and I thought it was a good opportunity. I understand he was being manipulative. I don’t normally apologize. I’m not like constantly apologizing or anything. I realize I messed up by apologizing. Jeesh. Haha. I got it. "
426,1jsrdff,Not the A-hole,AITA? Husband hasn’t spoken to me for 3 weeks,"So 3 weeks or so ago my husband was talking about his diet & I mentioned about how he should have more fibre in it and he was like ‘how do I get more fibre’ and mentally I thought we both have access to google but I didn’t want to be rude so I replied with the answer(s) and he goes ‘you wouldn’t make meals like that for me would you’ and I responded ‘I’m your wife not your mother’. He said it was an extremely rude thing to say and hasn’t spoken to me in 3+ weeks. For context we have 3 children and he is only here for a day and a half a week as he works away so he would have expected me to bulk cook on the weekend for him to take with him. My response wasn’t meant maliciously and I haven’t apologised because I genuinely meant it, we have been together for 15 years & it genuinely made me feel so resentful, the way he said it and the expression was puppy doggish and it made me feel like he was manipulating me - he can never be bothered to research or implement for his health even though he’s a highly intelligent and capable man. I guess I feel frustrated he will pour everything into work (15 hour days etc) but on the home front, the boring day to day it’s all on me. This isn’t the first time he’s ’gone silent’ but I usually always make good or apologise and this time I haven’t. It’s just so awkward and the longer it goes on the more resentful I feel over it - he’s pretty much my only solid adult interaction in person, both physically and mentally and I feel super alone but also sorry for him because he must really be a sad and cruel person to inflict this on another person. Writing this has made me realise just how deeply unhappy I am with him LOL, but anyway, AITA? 

Edited to add - he is on a salary & very high up in his company - he earns the same for a 40 or 80h work week, he is not paid by the hour and overtime isn’t a ‘thing’ for the role he has - he isn’t being forced to stay there by anyone but himself. 

I WFH 6-8h days on the weekdays and a couple of hours across weekend days. 

Edit 2 - thank you for all your responses. I wasn’t looking for some sort of validation of me not being the AH -  I know my comment was out of line and rude regardless of my intent, but I didn’t feel it justified 3 weeks (going on 4) of the cold shoulder. I guess I just wanted some differing view points from others because sometimes you don’t think rationally or fairly when you’re in a situation & I was beginning to question if I should apologise regardless of him ignoring me just to make good and make peace. For clarity he has a chef that makes his meals mon-fri & I cook for the household ofc no questions asked on the weekend and don’t have an issue with this. The responses have given me a lot to think about. "
427,1jsrach,Not the A-hole,AITAH for accidentally touching with my feet the bag of the person in front of me on a train?,"So, I was on a train (it was a 4 hour ride). I took my seat and put my bag in the dedicated space. In front of me there was a girl who had not put theirs, but instead had it on the floor, in the space between me and her. The thing is, that space is not that big and none of us could stretch their legs. After an hour or so I started to feel some pain in my legs and decided to try to stretch them, and accidentally touched the girl’s bag a few times. Note that I couldn’t stretch them sideways because there were people both next to me and her. She didn’t say anything then, but at the end of the ride, she told me that I was deliberately kicking and dirtying her bag. 
Was I the asshole in this situation? 
Like, I could have tried to move a bit but I didn’t want to bother the passengers next to us, but at the same time she could have placed her bag in the designated place and not on the floor."
428,1jsr7rf,Asshole,AITA for talking back to my mother,"Ao today I had an argument with my mother about me not cutting my hair and she decided to throw and trantrum for no reason at all. Just so you know my hair is like not very long, it's just long for my school standard and she is also a teacher that is very strict about my hair, I also rarely have normal length hair. She started telling that I always talk back to her even though I'm just telling her my opinion on the subject. 

Should I apologize?"
429,1jsqoch,Asshole,AITAH for having and untrained dog?,"so for background information, i (17) have two mini aussies. i got mine for my birthday about 4 years ago, nova. a little over a year ago my mom got another one for herself, nash, because one: we had lost our childhood dog, two: we wanted to breed them. my mom had been battling cancer for 2 ish years when we got him, and at this point she was doing extremely well. unfortunately not long after we got nash her heath started to decline. and since i was at school and work all day, i didn’t have time to really train him. obviously we fed, bathed, let him play etc. but he didn’t get that essential training time as a puppy.

this is where the issue comes in. my mom passed this last summer so i live with my aunt, my best friend also had issues with her home situation so she moved in with us as well. i now have inherited nash as my full responsibility. i try my best to teach him what i can but he is already old enough where he’s getting stuck into his own ways. my aunt, best friend, other friends, other family, all complain about him. and when i try to explain it’s not his fault they brush it off. i feel terrible for him because he’s always getting yelled at or pushed away. he is crazy, like bull in a china shop crazy. and i understand it’s annoying. but everyone acts like it’s my fault. i’ve had multiple people ask why i haven’t found him a new home, because he jumps all over people, he will jump on or over EVERYTHING knocking things down, he licks constantly, he will drag anything to close into his cage and chew it up no matter what it is, he gets under peoples feet, steals food, and gets into trash. with all that being said, some of these things are not super often and preventable. he is still young and has tons of energy, and unfortunately i now work a full time job and still dont have a whole ton of time to work with him. but i dont understand why people are upset with me over it, or why they are extremely rude to him.

to clarify a couple things, i still live at my moms home. my aunt moved in with me. also nash was originally and always my moms dog until she passed. our other aussie is extremely well trained, we did our research on the breed before we even got her. and lastly, we are not “backyard breeding” we had everything we needed and it was a one time thing. they are fixed now. with all that being said i will look into getting him professionally trained as well as make more time to work one on one."
430,1jsq2n0,Asshole,AITA for not thanking one of my closest friend for choosing my birthday over an evening with friends ?,"I saw him yesterday. We were talking casually, about what was going on in our lives, and he told me he had something planned with friends (that I don't know, we live in different cities) on the date of a certain tv show. I realized that it might be the day I planned to have my 30th birthday party. So we looked at the dates and what I thought was true. I asked him on March 25th if this date was ok for him, and he said it was. He thought like one minute about it, and told me he was choosing my birthday party over his other friends. I just said ""ok"". He instantly blurted ""Don't say thanks, why won't you?"". (in our original language, I said ""D'accord"" and he said ""Dis pas merci blabla"", the blabla is here because I know his sentence was longer but I couldn't understand it because he said it quickly, maybe it was ""Dis pas merci surtout!"" but I am not sure. I translated as close as I could.

I was in shock, because it didn't sound like him. He immediately apologized for the tone he used, but not for what he said.

I didn't say thanks. I am unsure why, but I feel it is his choice to make, so thanking him for choosing me over his friends feels like he's doing it for me, rather than for him. Like he'd rather be with them, but he doesn't want me to be disappointed.

I know I would have answered ""ok"" either way. It is his choice. I am not going to think less of our relationship because he cannot be here for a party. And I know he has trouble organizing his calendar, he often mixes up dates and hours. It's who he is and I learned over the years not to be disturbed by it anymore.

My birthday party is just the occasion for me to get all the people I love in one place. If they cannot be here for x or y reason, it doesn't mean they love me any less. I would of course be super happy if everyone could be here, but the opposite is really not the end of the world.

Him asking me to thank him for choosing me feels really wrong. If someone can help me see his point of view, that would be great. I will ask him about it, but I need some kind of input/theory to talk to him about it since he is susceptible.

And of course, AITA for not thanking him? Am I missing something ?

Edit : input of original conversation.

Edit 2 : Adding the date at which I told him when I was planning to have my birthday, and that he said then it was ok.

  
UPDATE : I sent a virtual letter to him yesterday, explaining my point of view, and asking him to explain his. He read it and answered, in the same form. Turns out he needed to make a quick choice, otherwise it would have taken him days and would have been draining for him. So he said it aloud quickly to make it ""official"" in his head, so he wouldn't go back and forth wondering at which event he wanted to go. It startled me, so my answer came out as distant, and a thought came to him saying that I didn't care about him. So he blurted out the rest. But when we began talking again normally, he knew that the thought was wrong and that I care about him. It was a double misunderstanding, we explained and understood each other, and our relationship is stronger than ever.

Thank you all for your inputs, even the derogatory ones were useful in a way. Have a good day."
431,1jspq9r,Not the A-hole,AITA for monopolizing a group chat while in crisis?,"I (30F) was in a group chat Allison (31F), Megan (31F), and Jen (32F). 

We have been friends since high school and have used the chat as a place to talk and vent. Allison and Jen have gone through severe depression, relationship/family issues, and more. 

My father passed away in November. His birthday was April 1. 

I have ongoing issues with my live in mother in law. Megan lived with her boyfriend’s parents for a long time and it severely impacted her mental health. Allison has issues with her MIL. We have used the group chat to vent. 

A couple months ago, Megan left the chat for issues not related to me. She and I were the most active in the chat. The dynamic in the chat shifted after she left, and I was more active than others, but still asking the others about their lives. 

This Thursday I had an argument with my MIL and then my husband. I was in crisis and decided to visit my hometown and for 4 days. From Thursday-Tuesday, I vented to the group about both my issues at home and feelings about my dad

On Wednesday, Allison sent a long message to the group saying I had turned it into a “crisis hotline” and am not taking steps to change or my situation. She said I have been in crisis for 6 months, which I don’t feel is true (6 months is close in date to when my dad passed). 

I would have no issue if she said she needs a break for her mental health and cannot hold space for friends. I felt her message was cruel. 

When Allison left the chat, she said “I hope you both feel like you can directly reach out/message me to keep in touch”. I sent her a message the same length as the final message in group chat, and did not hear back. I felt hurt and sent another message today. 

She replied, and in the message said that my dad lived a full life (he had me at 59 and my mom was 40, so I will lose both parents at a much earlier age than most of my peers. She said I “completely dismissed” her very cherished dog passing less than a year ago. When her dog passed, I offered support and condolences in the chat. She says I had “rich parents” (based on my mom’s current financial situation, it is very likely that I will get no inheritance at all). My parents weren’t wealthy, just older and retired with more disposable income. She said I had a college fund. Her parents paid for her college education. 

She and her husband are very well off and he has generational wealth. They are currently living abroad for a year and she has had difficulty adjusting and experienced depression. 

She says I am making “everyone’s struggle a competition” and I don’t think that’s true. I think there is a sense of scale, and not all problems have the same sense of severity, particularly problems that can be solved with money. 

AITA?"
432,1jsppjc,Asshole,AITAH for taking a step back from my friendship with someone because they didn’t tell me about their new job relationship?,"Typo in title: “… they didn’t tell me about their new relationship” 

I (22F) and my friend ""Lenny"" (23M) have been friends for about 4 years since we met in university. He's gone through a lot psychologically especially when it comes to relationships, after a long break he decided to start dating again last year and although he's never been the type to typically share things about his life, he did sometimes tell us (his friends) about his dates.

However, two weeks ago we went to a mutual friend ""Deena"" (23F) birthday party. At this party Lenny had asked me if Deena's friend ""Kelly"" (22F) was single because he thought she was cute and I jokingly discouraged him (it's an inside joke). Anyways, I left this party early so I didn't know what happened afterwards.

About a week later I asked Lenny for an update on if anything happened between him and Kelly after I'd left, to which he basically avoided answering by telling me he was at work and he'd tell me when he got home (he never did). This was fine because l'd assumed he didn't want to tell me because he either didn't make a move or he did and things didn't go as planned. But this weekend, I heard from Deena that Lenny and Kelly are basically in a full blown relationship now.

So I texted Lenny to ask him about it and he confirmed the relationship but it felt like he didn't want me to know. I asked why he didn't tell me because I thought we were friends and he said ""well I don't tell my friends anything"". He had also alluded to something else happening that night that left him feeling manipulated and embarrassed but I'm not insisting on him telling me about that because I know he was quite drunk already by the time I left.

I am very happy for him and happy to see him finally be in a relationship where he seems genuinely happy especially with all his previous experiences. I think I just feel completely left out and feeling like l'm having to beg or force information out of him.

So AITAH for taking a step back from our friendship because I feel like he doesn't trust me enough as a friend to tell me such positive news, especially since our other friends know about it?

(Just to add that James and Deena used to like each other last year but things didn't work out between them so they chose to remain friends)

Edit 1: I just wanted to clarify a few things that’s have come up.
 
 - I do not have a problem with the relationship or the person he is with. I’m a very happy that he’s in a happy relationship especially with his past experiences. 

- I also do not have some hidden feelings for him lol. I’m bi but mostly interested in women. 

- Me joking discouragingly him wasn’t to tell him not to go for it. It’s a joke we have in the friend group and it’s not intended to stop him for actually going through with talking to someone or starting a relationship and he knows this. 

- I assumed we were close friends enough because he had said so himself that I’m one of his closest friends. 

Edit 2/ update: I’ve been labeled the asshole lol but I wanted to give an update that somewhat clears things up I guess. 

Lenny and I met up for breakfast and spoke about the whole issue, I had made it clear that I was happy for him and apologized if I made him feel discouraged or unable to trust me. He assure me that it wasn’t that he didn’t trust me and that the joke had nothing to do with his decision because that’s all it was, a joke. 

However, he further explained that after I left the party, he and Deena had kissed / made out before he approached Kelly, which made him feel manipulated and embarrassed (I genuinely didn’t know about this). And long story short, Deena is no longer friends with Lenny and Kelly and he thought I knew about the whole thing and was taking her side (because I’ve known her for longer). 

I explained that this was the first time I was hearing the whole story, and I wasn’t taking any sides. When Deena told me about the relationship, she left out everything else. I apologize again for making him uncomfortable for asking about the relationship and that I wasn’t aware of the drama surrounding it. It was just a messy situation that came with a lot of assumptions being made. I will still be giving him space do deal with all the drama and I’m definitely distancing myself from Deena for now. 

Thanks for all your input (especially those who tried to see things from my side). It wasn’t that I demand that he tell me everything about the relationship, it was more the exclusionary feeling of finding out that everyone knows something but you.

433,1jsp3af,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not getting my sister something while she was on her period, and insulting her?","My (19m) gf (19f) has cancer. She's been really sensitive to the chemo and her meds so she is really weak, but sometimes she's also sore so she hasn't been sleeping much. This has been a big issue for her as it just makes the chemo and recovery worse. She had a chemo session on Friday early in the morning and she came over to my place so we could hang out and I could take care of her. 

She ended up passing out on me and before she fell asleep was telling me about how she was feeling bad overall. I was happy she was resting and didn't want to wake her up. My sister (16f) was on her period She texted me to ger her some water

Our other sister (14f) was at the store and would be home in like 5 minutes. Because my gf was asleep on me I didn't want to wake her up I told her to wait. She said she didn't want to wait and told me to ger her water. I told her no, and explained that my gf was asleep and that I wasn't going to wake her up. We went back and forth untill my sister called me a lazy fucking bitch. I told her that I wasn't going to wake her up to get fucking water, I'm going to care for my gf. She then said that she didn't care abt my stupid gf. I told her to fuck off, and I called her a bitch. (that was all over text btw) She told me I was a dick, and has ignored me any time I've tried speaking to her and I talked about this with our other sister who says I over-reacted and that I should apologize and that I should have just gotten her water. I'm starting to feel that I over-reacted and I also believe that maybe I should have gotten her the water,"
434,1jso17j,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my dad's wife I'm sorry but she's not my mom?,"I (16M) was the product of what is pretty much a friend with benefits type relationship between my dad (at the time 33) and my mom (at the time 22.) My mom didn't want to be a mom. Yet my dad didn't want my mom to abort. From what little I have been told there was an agreement. My mom would leave, my dad would raise me on his own but if she wanted to, she could come back into my life whenever.





The first 7 years of my life were just my dad and I. He didn't date any other woman; it was just us two and his family. I remember my mom would send me gifts on my Birthday and Christmas with letters attached. I remember members of her family doing the same. When I turned 7, my mom came back. I started spending time with her. She would take me to parks, zoos, and aquariums etc. I also met her family. I loved this, although I now know my dad didn't like the fact that my mom randomly showed up out of nowhere wanting to spend time with me, although he did soften up to it over time. I still have contact with my mom. I don't see her as often as before. But I still love her and see her as much as possible.



There was no conflict due to this situation at all until when I was 14, my dad met a new woman. I will call ""A"" for this. A and my dad started dating when I was 14, married when I was 15. A brought her twins (15M for both) from her previous relationship into her marriage with my dad. I have a good relationship with both my stepbrothers. I have a decent relationship with A but 2 things always bugged me. 1. How my dad seemed to rush into marrying A (he proposed to her 3 months into their relationship.) 2. A wanted me to call her mom literally the day I met her. She had two reasons for this. 1. I don't have a mom, and I need one. 2. She wants our family to be more united. I always just shrugged this off. I got away with it because when my dad married A it's like he forgot about me completely and didn't care about me. I also felt like it wasn't my place to complain. 



That's the context of all of this. We're a year into Dad and A's marriage. A's birthday is coming up. All of us bought her a gift but she says she doesn't like physical ones and also said she wants a more ""verbal gift"" from me. Last night at dinner I learned what this was. She asked me if I say yes to letting her adopt me so she could be my mom. Of course it caught me off guard. I said no, I already have a mom. A doesn't like the fact I talk to my actual mom still, and she said that she's my mom because she's at home with me every day and is married to my dad. Then called my actual mom a part timer in my life. I told her no, I'm sorry I can't her son but even if my actual mom is a part timer she was there for me a long time before she was. I received an angry scolding for this from both my dad and A. A specifically has been cold towards me since then. I'm struggling to comprehend this, and need to ask anonymously if I was in the wrong here?"
435,1jsno66,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling a kid he can’t steal?,"This accident happened last night while I was at work. I work at an ""entertainment hotel"" where we have lots of attractions for parents to purchase admission for their kids. One of our most popular attraction requires these bags of dirt that have gems and stones inside that you can purchase from the outlet I was working at. We keep these bags in a chest that is almost out of sight from the counter I stand behind. These bags are not cheap, a 3 pound bag is $14 and a 10 pound bag is $38. Well, 15 minutes before my shift is over, a little girl ran up to me to alert me about a little boy that ran off with a bag. I asked her to point him out to me, and I moved over to him before he could dump out the bag into the water stream where you sift for the gems. As I walked over, I realized there were multiple kids with bags that I did not sell to them. In front of the kids were their parents, who I stood right in front of as I questioned the boy. I said to the boy “hi, did you purchase this?”. He responds, “purchase?” in a confused manner. I knew then that I was in for a TREAT as his mother came up to me. She asks, “whats the problem?”, I respond, “I think your kid has been stealing these bags from our chest”. She goes, “they were not STEALING. Everyone was doing this."" I look at her in disbelief and say, “honey, you have to buy these”. She goes, “well nobody was over there!”. I respond, “Thats where I work. You buy them through me. I work right there.” She then looks at my name tag and says, “Oh thanks (name). That really helps. We’ll do that next time.” I go, “Please.” before just walking away because I could not believe the ignorance. She nor any of the other parents offered to cover the costs of the bags sold, which was well over $150.

I sat and thought to myself, my mother would be SO embarrassed if an employee informed her that I was just grabbing bags and using them without her knowledge. This woman clearly turned a blind eye to the fact that her kid was stealing these bags. They were 10 pound bags for God’s sake like it didn’t just appear out of thin air! I would have at least questioned my son on where he got it? Who knows.

My managers really couldn’t do anything about the thefts. I let them know incase she made a bad review about me since she spitefully said my name. Really unfortunate situation for the kid because he wont learn anything from the ordeal so thats too bad."
436,1jsnfe6,Not the A-hole,AITA for not paying a friend more?,"My father got an estimate for cleaning up his yard that was a little overgrown. My friend, who my dad has given random stuff too when she asked for it, agreed to help out And said she didn’t expect him to pay her. She ended up coming in a second day and we were out for seven hours including in 90° weather. My father bought lunch for us twice And bought some food to go. He also ended up giving she and her husband ((who also helped with pressure washing) $140. 

We hung out at my pool for a while after that and I knocked out and woke up to a message saying she calculated the hours they worked and the conditions and thinks they were grossly underpaid and that it should be revisited.

I am stunned and I don’t know if I should tell my father he needs to pay them more, or tell her she had said she was going for Free so I’m confused as to how she thought he was paying her a different amount. 

Which one of us is the asshole?  "
437,1jsn2x7,Asshole,AITA for sending my friend a YouTube video,"So for context my friend and I are extremely close, we talk regularly and often tease each other in unharmful ways. The other day I noticed she started acting strange, we were practicing dance move we saw on ticktock (my ticktock account) she did it in a weird way and I minced it saying ""What is this"" in an obvious playful tone. She then lashed out at me saying ""can you shut up for one second"" I left her alone and later texted her asking what was wrong, she didn't respond so t
I texted again,and she responded with ""I obviously don't want to talk get the hint"". The next morning she texted apologizing saying ""she was on her period and was already annoyed from someone else that day."" I accepted her apology and moved on, later that day I sent her a YouTube short. For context her parents won't allow social media of any kind. I sent the video having a brain fart and forgetting she didn't have YouTube. She then texted me saying ""girl you know I can't watch that, not all of us are allowed to download apps like you, you should have known better than to rub salt into the wound."" So AITA for sending her the video



Update: I gave my friend a few days to cool off before we spoke in person again. When we spoke she mentioned that she gets worked up really easily and felt bad for yelling at me while also knowing I have a terrible memory. I told her it was okay because I should have remembered that she doesn't have YouTube. We made up and are now happily talking."
438,1jsmgd1,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my friend that her trauma dumping was emotionally draining?,"I (F, college senior) used to be close with “Lena.” We’d known each other for a couple of years before I moved abroad for university. Early on, our friendship was great. But things shifted after I left.

She’d call or message at all hours—sometimes at 3 or 4 a.m. my time—venting about fights with her parents or her emotional struggles. I’d listen, comfort her, and give advice. But it became constant, and always negative. I felt like she only opened up to me because I was empathetic, not because she cared about my well-being.

I also helped her get into the same scholarship program I’m in. I guided her through interviews, shared resources, everything. She got in—she’s smart, but I know my help mattered.

When she came to the country for school (a year behind me), she started dating someone in another state. It was a messy, on-and-off thing. She became even more dependent on me—calling constantly, venting about the relationship, pushing boundaries. She once told me to send her my weekly schedule so she could plan hangouts whenever I was free. I’m introverted and need downtime, but she made me feel guilty for it.

When I adopted a cat (a dream I’d had forever), she criticized me for spending money on vet bills—after my cat was diagnosed with asthma. This came from someone who once paid $200 to attend a party.

We had a falling out during her freshman year and didn’t speak for months. She later apologized, and I agreed to meet to give the friendship another shot. But the moment we met, she started trauma dumping again, like nothing had changed. This went on for another year. I kept helping her, but I felt resentful and drained. I started snapping at others who didn’t deserve it. That’s when I went to therapy and began distancing myself.

In a conversation with her and a mutual friend (who also had issues with her emotional dumping), I casually said, “You used to trauma dump on me, and it was draining.” She got really upset and said, “I didn’t know being my friend was so draining. That hurt.”

Now I’m wondering… was I too harsh? I didn’t say it to be mean—I just finally spoke honestly after years of suppressing how I felt.

AITA?"
439,1jsmdls,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my roommate to be more considerate of our shared space?,"I currently live in a shared space similar to a dorm room with one roommate. Ever since we moved in together, about a month ago, I feel as if she's been inconsiderate and disrespectful of our shared space. Any time that we are both in the room, she is constantly singing, talking aloud, and dancing very loudly. The actual actions are not really the issue, for me it's the volume. I am extremely afraid of confrontation, but it got to a point where I had to say something. Last week, at 2:30am, she was watching a video very loudly. Though I wasn't sleeping yet, it was still bothersome. Previously, she had fallen asleep with a similar video playing very loudly and I couldn't sleep that night, so I wanted to ask her ahead of time to avoid that. She got a bit of attitude and asked if I wasn't sleeping, why was it an issue? I very calmly said that it was late and explained that I didn't want her to fall asleep with it still playing. She turned it down, but had a lot of attitude about it.

A few days ago, she was talking very loudly. She is very spiritual, and I think she does this to kind of put things into the universe. I had headphones on with the volume up nearly all the way, and could still hear her. I took my headphones off to ask her to keep it down, and she very plainly said no. This was after an entire week of never having peace, so I got a little heated when explaining that I feel like she's inconsiderate. We ended up getting into a screaming match. She told me that she isn't going to ""stop expressing herself"" or ""dim herself for someone else."" I feel bad, because I don't want her to stop expressing herself, I just want to compromise. She resorted to a lot of insults, telling me I needed to ""get a life,"" ""get new headphones,"" and ""find peace within myself."" Any time I told her she was inconsiderate, she said she ""didn't give a fuck."" By the end of the argument, we were both just repeating ourselves, so l asked if she was willing to compromise. She said no, so I put my headphones back on and went about my night.

I guess I'm struggling with wondering if I'm in the wrong. We share a room, and we do not have a common area that I can resort to when this happens. I do think I could have handled it better, because I am the one who got loud first, but I was so fed up with situation after already asking her to keep it down before. I am constantly subjected to hearing personal details about her life, and it makes me uncomfortable. I am trying to request a new roommate, but it takes time.

I've been cooking and cleaning and paying for food for their fat asses for 12 straight years since my mother died when i was 1 1/2 years old and my step-mother divorced him me and my sisters have been treated like maids and even sometime his wife even though we are his children so i yelled at him saying i'm not his fucking wife and we got into a screaming match that ended with me leaving with what i could fit into a bag and taking 3 busses to get to my aunts house and sleeping on the couch. Yesterday my father called the cops to report me ""missing"" and later that night i was taken back to my father and i'm writing this from my bathroom because my father has been trying too lay his hands on me (he is drunk) so AITA for yelling at my dad and running away?

Nancy and MIL were talking about wedding plans at the end for family dinner at this time I was over everything and emotionally drained from stress and personal matters and had  been not participating in most conversations through the night as not to snap, but in simple terms my social battery died. She asked me about dresses and if I had gotten one yet ;a little more context I'm not in the wedding my only 'job' is to keep the brides mom occupied so bride doesn't stress I can do that and happy to; I told her I may have one but will buy. She had been asking me every time she saw me so I admit my tone could have been nicer she then asked if I can just go get a dress. I couldn't I was in the middle of buying a house husband I didn't have the extra finances to do that.

My SIL and I are both pregnant with girls due within 2 months of each other, I’m first. We shared with them the baby’s middle name before they found out they were having a girl and they recently told us they were considering a nearly identical first name and the same middle name. When i was surprised that it was almost the same exact name she acted surprised like we haven’t previously shared the name. Which we did on multiple accounts. 

She said she was ok naming them the same if she decided on that name I said it could be confusing and not ok with it. She’s now been sharing with everyone that they decided to name the baby that name and I feel extremely pressured and manipulated into going along with it. I feel like she took the name (it’s not significant to her in anyway, I asked) and when my husband and I previously shared the name we explained the significance etc. "
444,1jsko5e,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to make my daughter apologize to a girl she made mad?,"My daughter 11f had a soccer game today and I 39m was able to take her. I also took one of her teammates 11f home from their game as well. 

This girl and my daughter are kinda friends but they aren't super close and IMO the girl can be kinda mean sometimes and she was on the ride home. 

My wife and I still have our daughter in a high back booster seat even though it's not a legal requirement at her age in our state and this girl doesn't use one. 

She started making fun of my daughters booster seat saying things like "" your a big baby "" and "" you sit in a baby seat "". My daughter got upset but then told this girl "" i like my booster seat i can see out the window a lot better then you can with it "" and "" i have my owne seat in the car just for me with my own cupholders and a special place for my snacks "" she then proceeded to show this girl the secret compartment her booster seat has that she keeps her snacks and sometimes toys in. 

This made the girl stop teasing my daughter about her booster seat and the rest of the ride went okay. We dropped the girl off at her house and then we went home. 

But later I got a call from the the girls mother, she was furious with me saying that her daughter came home and said my daughter was very mean to her and made fun of her for not having a booster seat. 

I told her that her daughter wasn't being very nice and maybe if she was nicer to my daughter this wouldn't have happened. But this just made her more mad. 

She said I was a terrible father and still insisted I make my daughter apologize to her daughter but I still refused because i don't think my daughter has anything to apologize for. 

Since then she has sent me a few angry text messages demanding I make my daughter apologize. 

AITA? "
445,1jskgo7,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to help my brother with his class because he doesn't care enough to do the reading?,"I want to make it clear that we do online schooling. So my(19f) brother (16m) is taking a digital photography elective as to get credits to graduate. He's overall not into school at all and he's made very clear that he does not give a shit about this elective. He isn't into photography at all, but he wants to pass the class, obviously. I totally get it and I've had electives that I didn't care about topic-wise, but know I needed to pass.

The trouble is that I've been doing basically all the teaching to him about digital photography. I can't stress enough that the teacher provides everything he needs with videos and reading lessons. Basically when he gets assignments, which include taking photos based on what he's (should be) learning, I have to explain everything that's going on to him. How to navigate the camera (he uses mine which I'm perfectly fine with), it's settings, stuff like the rule of thirds, etc. I'm decently well-versed in photography and can explain everything to him pretty fine, it's just tiring. 

I've asked him why I have to explain all this to him, in which I've gotten 2 contradictory answers: he's explicitly told me he doesn't care enough to read or watch the lessons or (he told me like 15 minutes ago) the teacher apparently doesn't tell him how to navigate the camera and explain the settings of the camera. I know the second one's a lie, because I took the exact class he's taking. I was fine at first showing him how to navigate it, because the whole thing can be confusing at first! And I've had to help him the past few years with some homework with classes like math and I always ask him if he did the readingz which he almost always replied no because ""the reading is optional"" which, sweet Christ, no it fuckin isn't!

I've gotten tired of it. I do feel like an asshole because I am able to explain everything to him and he can complete his assignments just fine. But all of the work of the teacher is falling on me because he just doesn't fucking care. Which, again, I understand not caring about certain topics of your electives and passing them just for the credits. But I did the work in high school whether I liked it or not. My dad literally doesn't care as long as my brother passes and my mom doesn't really have a say because my dad's word is the most important (according to him), and she's asking that I help my brother.

Sorry if this was long... And petty. But I've been given the work of explaining the entirety of the assignments when my brother is perfectly capable of reading and watching the lessons from his class. I'm kinda used to this being an older sister, but my brother is 16 and able to read, has good grades otherwise, and is giving me work that I wouldn't have to be doing if he did the bare minimum of a class."
446,1jsk8vt,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking my mom out after she brought illegal substances and paraphernalia,"My husband and I let my mom move in with us last year because she was in a bad living situation. She wasn’t homeless but the people she lived with were toxic and she needed to get out of there. Fast forward to this year and her brother passed away, my uncle. She had to go and clean his apartment and she brought a whole bunch of his stuff back to my house, which was fine. But after 6 weeks or so she mentions to me that she found illegal substances in his place and she was driving around with it for a while because she didn’t know what to do with it, so she decided to store it in her room. I was very upset and she said she would get rid of it. A few weeks go by and I was talking to my husband and I told him what she told me. He confronted her about it and she told him she got rid of it. He asked her if he searched her room, would he find it where she told me it was and She said no. So he searches her room and finds it right where she told me it was. She starts freaking out saying that she thought she had gotten rid of it, but me and my husband ultimately decided that she needed to leave. We have a 2 year old in our home so this is not something we take lightly. But my mom is normally a very caring person otherwise, but she made a very bad judgement call. Now I’m feeling really guilty that we shouldn’t have jumped the gun and kicked her out. Am I the asshole? "
447,1jsjztg,Not the A-hole,AITA for expecting my wife to do more for the household?,"Me, 44M, work from home and am fortunate enough to earn enough for my wife, 43F, not need to work. I'd love it if she could find a job but it's not easy as we live in a foreign country and employment is tough. She hasn't worked for 10 years and has given up on looking for a job -- to be clear, I'm fine with that (honestly even proud that I can support us both).

I work 10-12hrs per day from home and I am the one cooking, going grocery shopping, taking out the trash and also participate in the house cleaning (mainly the vacuuming part). My wife handles the dish washing, laundry and feeding the pets. I don't want to sound chauvinistic but it's hard to ignore the time I need to invest in a week on work, cooking, shopping, etc, versus the time she puts in doing chores that basically rely on a machine doing the heavy lifting and/or take only a few minutes a day. 

I'm finding it hard to even get ""me"" time for my hobbies and to unplug. I work from 9am to 7pm sometimes later, after which I start cooking, eat and then it's basically bed time. During the day if we need groceries, I use my lunch hour to dash to the supermarket and get whatever we need. I might get about 1-2h or potential me time but it's frustrating that time only comes at the tail end of the day right before bed when all my energy is gone. 

Lately I've tried talking about it  because I don't think this is fair; all I ask is that since she is not working that she cooks more, gets groceries now and again and helps me so I can also enjoy a proper weekend.

She says I ""sound like Andrew Tate"" or ""like a toxic alpha male"".

Mind you, I love cooking and I believe we should SHARE chores; I just don't feel like we are sharing. I feel like I do 70% of the work. I am not looking for sympathy, I'm looking to understand what others think about this situation as maybe I am wrong. In my mind, if I'm working this hard to support us, cooking, buying the food, etc, and she is basically only needing to load ad unload a dishwasher & a laundry machine, this is not balance. Her not working is not my fault and I've told her she doesn't need to work unless she wants to but at the same time, if she decided not to work and not even look for a job, I believe she should reciprocate through support (physical and emotional).

TL;DR: My wife has not worked or looked for a job for the last 10 years. I work 10-12h and also cook, clean, buy groceries and take out the trash. My weekends don't feel like weekends and I'm getting tired so I've pushed back and asked for balance. We talked about it recently and wife hinted at my behaviour being toxic like Andrew Tate or whatever other figure heads that portray males as superior to females. I disagree, I just want a fair split of effort since this is taking its toll and I don't feel like I have enough time for myself and unwind."
448,1jsjxgj,No A-holes here,AITA for entertaining a guy my friend tried to go on a date with?,"A couple of years ago, I 22F used to talk to this guy 26 —not super serious, just casual. About a year after things fizzled out, one of my friends tried to go on a date with him, but he ended up ghosting her (she didn’t know that we dealt with each other at all). She told me at the time that she didn’t really care, and she’s now in a completely different relationship. Recently, this guy reached out to me again trying to rekindle things. We’ve been talking, but I don’t see it going anywhere serious. I’m wondering if I should mention it to my friend, even though it happened a while ago and she’s clearly moved on. We’re getting breakfast tomorrow, so it could be a good time to bring it up, but I also don’t want to make a big deal out of something that might not even matter to her. Should I say something, or just let it be?"
449,1jsjqd8,Not the A-hole,AITA for not agreeing to drive my friend far?,"I'm somebody who tends to just stay in my hometown because I'm a sucky driver and going out far in other areas can be tough. I'm honestly just fine staying within my hometown because I've never really had the desire to branch out much anyway.

  
My friend on the other hand is pretty insistent on having us branch out and go to places that are like an hour away. She's always insisting that we go to those places. I'm generally fine with going to those places with her if she is the one driving us. However, she is really insistent on us taking turns driving whenever we hang out. It's a pretty fair system, but the thing is that I've expressed to her that I'm not personally comfortable going far when it's my turn to drive. She gets kinda annoyed and tells me how she's always driving me to far places (that she suggests) and that it's my turn to do the same.

  
I see where she is coming from and I do feel bad. AITA?"
450,1jsjlbh,Not enough info,AITA for urging quieter sing-along?,"My BF and I were out to dinner at a bar/grill.  There were 2 guys playing live music and singing next to our table.  My BF began singing along with them - really loud.  Like about as loud as he can sing.  He was drowning out the musicians.

I motioned him to decrease the volume a bit, which he did.  But then he stopped singing and talking to me.

I genuinely contributed over 90% of it myself so thought I might as well just use what we had started (but not finished) as my own project. The teacher then used “my” project as the exemplary example in front of the rest of the class and the other members of the original group are super mad.

452,1jsjcki,Not the A-hole,AITA For talking to another girl besides my girlfriend,"I (26M) and my girlfriend (26F) went to bar last night. We were talking a lot at the car but as soon as we got there, she had to go to the bathroom. I went over the bar and got a beer and noticed a girl was wearing a 49ers jersey so we start talking about them as they are my favorite team. my girlfriend walks over from the bathroom and immediately looks distress as she sees me talking to this girl. She runs over to me and says that we have to leave now and me being worried asked what’s wrong, but she doesn’t answer and dragged me out the door as soon as we got to the car she started yelling at me about cheating. I was confusing what she was talking about as I’ve never cheated in my life and then realize she’s talking about the girl I was talking to. I tried to explain myself, but she doesn’t listen and keeps on yelling. After she’s done, we drive home in silence. As soon as we get to the house, she runs to her room crying as I try to talk to her. She locks the door and yells that I can sleep somewhere else. When I wake up the next morning, I go to talk to her, but she already left me a text that she’s at her sister‘s house and will be staying there for a while. I tried to text her, but none go through and eventually, she says that she doesn’t wanna talk to me to stop. This all happened yesterday and I still don’t know what to do. AITA

Update: She has never acted like this before and has never been the Jealous type so this kind of shocked me as we talk a lot about us. 


Update: won’t go into too much detail about this as it has just happened. Some basic background info but her sister and I are slightly close as we both played in the same soccer club growing up, which is how I met her sister (now girlfriend). It is the same one that she went over to yesterday and she texted me telling me that her sister confess something to her. She said that she cheated on me two weeks ago and the guilt has been eating her up enough that she wants me to end the relationship so that she won’t feel bad. She wanted to blame me for cheating so that didn’t seem bad that she was cheating. I am heartbroken over this and don’t know how to move forward"

Since being a mom, it’s kind of difficult for me to deal with more than just my child right now due to my mental health state (super stressed from being in school, working full time and being a single mom). 

All of my siblings have had their children before me and I watched them basically my whole childhood/teen years (I’m the youngest). 

My sibling recently had a second child and has been complaining about me not offering to watch them. It’s nothing personal, I just don’t have the mental capacity. They had an even they wanted to attend, and have been hinting all week that they really needed a babysitter for the new baby. So, I tried to be nice and I said okay, I’ll watch the new baby but I can’t watch the older one as well. Two kids (including my child) are already pushing it and a third I just know I wouldn’t be able to handle it. 

It’s time for me to baby sit and they come with both kids. And say that the older one will be getting picked up and left for the event. When they left, the older one informed me no one is actually coming to get them.

He got mad at me and told me I'm wrong. "
455,1jsiteg,Asshole,"AITA for using AI to ""improve"" a custom song at my cousin's birthday party without telling anyone?","So, last week, my (25M) cousin (29F) had a birthday party, and she hired a singer to create a custom song about her life to play during the celebration. The lyrics were great, but the rhythm felt off, and honestly, the voice just wasn’t my thing—it was way too high-pitched for my taste. I didn’t think it was terrible, but I knew I could make it sound better with a little tweak.

I decided to use Suno AI to recreate the song with a different rhythm and a voice that sounded smoother. I didn’t think too much about it—just made a quick edit and swapped the original song with the one I created. To be honest, I didn’t even consider asking for permission from the singer or anyone else. It was a party, and I figured it wouldn’t be a big deal as long as the song was still about my cousin and the lyrics stayed the same.

My cousin was so happy with the new version of the song when it played at the party. She thought it sounded great, and everyone loved it. But, apparently, the singer who made the original song noticed what happened, and at the end of the night, he got into an argument with my cousin. From what she told me, he was really upset that I had swapped out his work without asking. He felt disrespected because I essentially used AI to ""improve"" his art without his consent.

I didn’t think it was that big of a deal since my cousin still paid him, and I thought he should be happy that his work was enjoyed in a different way. But now my cousin is really mad at me. She’s been avoiding talking to me all week and says I made everything awkward. I don’t get why she’s so upset. It was just a birthday song. He got paid, she got a better version, and no one really noticed the difference.

AITA for swapping the original song with an AI version without anyone’s consent?"

457,1jsi7dv,Everyone Sucks,AITA for complaining to my mum about her being up at 1AM?,"For context: I (16M) finish school at 5:00. By the time I get home, it’s 6:00. I have one hour for leisure, and my little brother (6M) is always on the PS4. I have study time till 8:00, then dinner, then bed. Rinse and repeat.

So the weekends are where I can relax for the day. Today, my mum decided to go out to a house party for the whole day. My dad wasn’t exactly in a good mood because of that. I went to the library with my friends until early afternoon. I came home to see my dad not doing anything in regards to cleaning the house in spite of my mother leaving him at home. The house was a mess, and, being the good son that I was, I decided to *clear* the room up. Dishes, countertops in the kitchen, clothes in the living room and some other stuff (I missed out a few stuff, I’ll explain later). 

My dad sat on his arse looking at his phone all day. After a long day, I relaxed from until around 11:00PM. I went downstairs to make food, and AS SOON AS I went downstairs, my dad followed, asking me to make him dinner. I made him dinner, and by then my mum had come home with my little brother. I haven’t had dinner yet. 

It’s 12:00AM and I’m helping my mum hoover and disassemble the stove stuff. I finally get to making my dinner. I just want some peace and quiet alone. I’m sitting, eating and watching Invincible while my mum does a few stuff in the kitchen. I hadn’t even finished my food for 2 MINUTES and she calls me back, making me dry the stove stuff. I asked her to let me finish my episode, and she said okay, but sounded annoyed. 

A few minutes after I sit down, my dad comes down, then my little brother comes down. It’s obvious that my dad hasn’t bothered putting him to sleep. Okay, that might be acceptable, but IT’S 1AM. I just want some peace and quiet, and (here’s where I may be the asshole) I complain to my mum about how I’m tired and everybody’s downstairs, including her and how I just want to sit and chill and finish my episode of Invincible in peace (it’s literally the last mfkin episode). She starts saying that ‘if you wanted peace and quiet move out’ and ‘go to a council house if you’re so independent’. 

So, Reddit. AITA? I sure feel like one, but couldn’t I just get a few moments of peace and quiet? It’s 1AM, I just want to sit and eat my (very late) dinner alone.

(I’ll add any missed details here)

- Yes, I share my bedroom with my little brother, and yes the downstairs is a common area. Not at 1AM though.

- I can’t watch Amazon Prime on my phone because I share passwords with my cousins, and I’m not allowed it in my room/on personal devices.

- There was not enough space in the air fryer for both me and my dad’s food to be done properly, so I went with making his first.

- The ‘party’ I mentioned that my mum went to? It’s not a normal party, more like a dinner.

- I should have mentioned that my brother GOT UP from sleeping.

- No comments about what time I eat. I’ll eat whenever I want, thank you; I always eat around midnight on a night that doesn’t have school the next day.

- About the hoovering at 12AM: From my language use i thought I made it clear without saying it that I was from the UK. We don’t have paper-thin plaster walls like in the US; our walls are bricked, with enough insulation to trap a heatwave inside. You can’t even hear the hoover from the other side of the house."
458,1jshv28,Not the A-hole,AITA for chewing out my sister after she left me at home,So like the title says I (19f) was left at home while my sister (30f) and her kid (7f) went to a family reunion we were all supposed to go to. I had been told we were leaving at 5 after my sister got off work. I had all of my things with me and ready to go by 3 as I know she occasionally gets off early. At 3:30 she had gotten off early and called for her kid and I just assumed she was getting her ready as I was in the bathroom and she had specifically only called for her daughter. When I got out of the bathroom everyone had already gone and I was left alone in a house with no food. I called my sister and asked if they had seriously just left and she told me yes because she told me to be ready by the time she was home. I got kind of upset at her implication me peeing was being unprepared and I raised my voice at her for leaving without even checking if I was actually ready so AITA?
459,1jshtra,Not the A-hole,"AITAH for not letting my stepson take ""his dog"" to his mom's house?","Edit to update. Husband flipped out on me after dropping A off, saying I was putting our marriage in jeporady by not just giving into his demands. Instead of waiting and having a rational conversation with me the next day, he acted as though this was a time sensitive matter, cornered and pressured me. Then took the dog to A's mom's house. We aren't currently on speaking terms as I feel this was a very unfair situation to put me in and was handled very poorly, he thinks I'm the one completely in the wrong for not folding to his sudden change of mind. 



About 6 years ago, I (41f) adopted dog for (then 9, now 16m) stepson, A. The dog was a foster that A's dad and I adopted for him for Christmas. I'm very against animals as gifts, but I'm in animal care and knew we would be sure the dog was cared for.

A used to take dog to his mom's, sometimes, but has been with us consistently for the past 2+ years. If the dog was left at mom's when he went to school, she wouldn't even let the dog pee before dropping A off at school and then bringing the dog to us so she didn't have to walk him. 

Last week A and his dad got in an argument, A left for his mom's. I did not allow him to take the dog. If I thought the dog would be cared for, I would let him go. But, over the last 6 years, I have paid for all of dogs vet care, done all of his grooming. His adoption papers and all of his records are in my name, so legally he is my dog. I walk him, clean up after him and make sure he is fed and has water. Dog usually is in A's room, A never kept fresh food or water for the dog, dispute us providing a food and water holder, spare dishes for it, a container of food for his room, and reminding him daily for months. He would forget to take him out to potty, let him out in the backyard, either forget him or ask his dad to let him back in. I get it, he's a kid. He doesn't want to take on any responsibilities, and he hasn't had to because everything has been done for him so far.
A has been at his mom's for a week now and has not asked for the dog once. Tonight he came to our house with 4 of his friends to celebrate his birthday. We have a slightly bigger home for company so even though he left our house because he wasn't treating his father right, his dad allowed to use our home to celebrate with his friends. Before he came over I talked to my husband about not allowing A to see the dog because it would get the dog worked up and I didn't feel it was fair to the dog. The dog has just started to adjust to not having A around and has finally stopped moping. My husband agreed with me about not letting him see the dog and agreed with me about keeping the dog when A first left. However once his son got here he started asking for the dog and apparently pulled his father aside and made a big deal about it. I text A (attached conversation). And suddenly my husband's perspective changed. He started acting like I was the bad guy and wanting me to just give him the dog saying that if we found out later he was neglected we could take him back. His mother is lazy and barely takes care of herself, the responsibility of the dog would fall on her and she would do the bare minimum. I don't feel A should be rewarded for his behavior by giving him his way and more importantly I don't think it's what's best for the dog. He's more than a Christmas present, he's a living creature with needs. 

Since my husband left to drive A and his friends home, A tried to call me and my husband text me to try to force me to talk to him.

AITH?

460,1jshc4m,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my friend he can’t be upset that a girl he had a crush on has a BF,"I f (22) was friends w this guy (25, brain fully developed btw). He was telling me about his work crush and he said “she has the perfect body and her face isn’t that bad”. I work with him so i know he has never spoken to this girl. This girl two days later becomes friends w me and I find out she has a bf. So I tell my friend cause I thought it would save him the embarrassment of trying to ask out a taken woman. Then he texts me and says he’s really disappointed and wished he didn’t tell me he had a crush on her. because he didn’t want to know she had a bf. He had told me he was going to ask her out, so he would’ve found out eventually anyway. And this makes me upset cause why are you so upset when you never spoke to this girl and we’ve only worked with her for 3 days. She also rarely talks at work so it’s not like he could like her personality from that. And now i’m friends with her and I actually like her a lot so it makes me even more upset that he would depersonalize her like that. I responded “you don’t know her, how could you ever care” I then realized that was a bit mean so i was like “it’s ok, i’m sure you’ll find someone eventually”. He proceeds to ignore me for two days so i txt him and ask if we were still on for hanging out tomorrow since we said we would before that text. He responds “no” so i tried to call him so we could talk and he declines. I texted him and he told me he was upset because of the comment. I explained that, as he knows since I have told him, i have been used for my body multiple times by men who don’t care about my personality. So when he made that comment about her body it upset me. He responded “Stop texting me” and i was confused and asked if he was serious?! he said “stop texting its bothering me”. And now I’m confused cause that feels like a crazy reaction in response to my text. I know it wasn’t nice but to stop being friends with me all together?! "
461,1jsh5n9,Not the A-hole,AITA for expecting my mom to take care of my grandmother?,"I'm 38 and have 2 kids, ages 13 and 8. I am at the end of a PhD program in mental health-- completing my internship now and graduating in a few months. Finally. 

We all have to complete an accredited internship program. I tried to maximize my chances of matching in my home state to be closer to my aging grandmother who has dementia. 

My grandmother had 3 children. 1 is still living. That child is my mother. 

My mother lives our of state, about 5 hours away, with my stepdad. My mom and I have had issues getting along my entire life (I believe she has a personality disorder). I could write books on all the fucked up things she has done. To my surprise, when my grandfather broke his hip and femur a couple years ago, my mom and stepdad were intermittently involved in helping care for him. My mom cared for him at the end of his life and stayed with my grandmother for several months afterwards. Then she just... left. Partially because she was so angry that her dad named my cousin (male, age 30) as his executor. My cousin was forced to block my mom's phone number after she left last year because she simply could not stop calling him to yell at him and tell him what a piece of shit he was. He never wanted to be the executor, but my grandfather gave him that responsibility after he turned 18 since it was his father who was originally the executor. My mother has never been named as a beneficiary or executor because they did not get along and he did not trust her. He was just as big of an asshole as she is. 

She does not work. She has not worked in about 2 years, in fact. Meanwhile my grandmother is still here. I live 2 hours from her. My cousin lives about 30 minutes from me. We trade off weekends caring for her and he manages her finances (which he does keep me in the loop about) and daily care while I have been working on her Medicaid application. I have a sister 90 minutes south whom I hope can start helping too. We have a home health aide who is with her for about 6 hours a day as well. She's only awake for about 9 hours or so a day so that's lucky. But we know this is a temporary fix. She shouldn't be alone at all, but there are legal issues keeping us from selling off assets to pay for assisted living right now. We hope it will be resolved soon. 

Meanwhile I am furious at my mother. I should be focused on my kids and my husband. I should be at the baseball field with them right now. But I'm not. Don't misunderstand-- I love my grandmother. I feel it is my responsibility to help care for her because my mother sucks so much. This morning she called me while I was on the way to my grandmother's house (haven't heard from her in months) and as soon as she started gossiping about my cousin I screamed at her and told her I didn't want to fucking hear it. Am I the asshole for yelling at her and being angry with her? "
462,1jsgjie,Not the A-hole,AITA for NOT Giving My Mom All of my Financial Info,"Sorry for the long post. I (19M) am currently a full time college student and I live alone. My parents (39M and 41F) have been divorced since I was 7 so about 12 years now and it has truly been a miserable experience. Throughout the entirety of those 12 years, my parents live on opposite sides of the country and can't seem to have a normal conversation about anything. Worst part about this is that they like to throw me and my other siblings into the middle and get our viewpoints to see who they can win over but never actually listen to what we say and why getting thrown into this is annoying.

Fast forward a bit, I live by myself in another state away from both parents. Thankfully, I've been able to have a good relationship with both of them while I've been in school. That is until about a couple weeks ago, when my dad told me that he would be reopening their child support case for my brother since the amount needs to be rebalanced as it hasn't been changed since it was initially opened 12 years ago and I no longer a child that lives with her. My mom has been freaking out as for the past 12 years, my dad has been paying her nearly 2.5 times the court mandated amount because she said it wasn't enough and he wanted to make sure me and my siblings had everything we needed and some.

Well, my mom texted me asking me for all of my finance information as she would be using them in her case for court. I asked why it was necessary as I support myself and my college and she told me to just give it to her for her case. I then told her that if the court needed any of my information that they could just ask me directly to disclose whatever information was necessary to the case since my info isn't necessary to either of their cases. She blew up on me at this point telling me that I was being ridiculous and that she'll just ""see me in court then if I want to act like a stupid bitch"".

A little time went by of me not responding to that and she asked if i was ready to""stop with my attitude and act like an adult"". I told her that was funny considering that she threw a tantrum when I wouldn't tell her my personal finances. I also explained to that I wouldn't be giving her this information but I want an apology for what she called me, but she told me that I only see things the way I want to and I'm being selfish for not giving her the information. I kinda lost it at this point and told her ""Wow my mom still not listening to what I'm trying to tell her. Fork found in kitchen"". She got really mad and has been texting me nonstop on how disrespectful I am and that I should know better than to talk to her that way.

I showed some of my friends the texts and they said that while she was being a jerk, that I was being just as big of one back. Honestly, saying it felt wrong but I wanted to stand my ground against it. The mixture of their reactions and my guilt have been making me feel bad and  should just give it to her, so AITA?

Edit: I should probably clarify something, before I moved away for school, I was living with my dad while my siblings lived with my mom. While I was still in high school, I was 100% a dependent of him, not her. That's why her asking for my info was so weird.

463,1jsg8gm,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking someone to make room on a coin operated machine?,"A few family friends took the kids to an indoor playground together today. There was a coin operated carousel with 3 seats, and a dad from our group offered to pay and have all our kids go on (1 pay, the whole thing starts). 2 of the kids from our group got on already, the dad's had his hand stretched ready to pay for the machine to start. My kid was about to get on the last seat, but suddenly a little kid not from the group just rushed to the last seat. 

We explained to the mom we are not paying for her kid, can she take her kid for a minute. The response we got was ""it's for everyone!"" And ""he hasn't paid YET"". 

So, if *I'm* just sitting at a coin operated thing, and someone comes along asking me to make room because they are actually paying for it to run, I'd make room, is it rude to ask that? Especially if you are not from the group. And for the ""not paid YET"" part.. what you want me to start the machine, then you take your kid off while it's running, and then I put my kid on while it's spinning?"

However, i feel as though if I'm putting in 40 hours a week in at work, and 4+ hours per week in to school, the least she could do is pick up around the house, (laundry, dishes, etc). I go to work 9-5, then we go to the gym, and then i come home and cook for us. Every time i try to express that our effort feels one sided, she says that I'm being unfair and that ""she shouldn't be the only one doing things around the house,"" which i agree with to an extent. But she does nothing worthwhile while I'm at work. She'll sleep, lay in bed on her phone, or play video games. I just don't know how to work something out.

But then he started asking if he could be alone in my room sometimes. I told him no—that if he wanted privacy, he could go to his car instead. He didn’t like that, and eventually started sneaking into my room when I wasn’t home.

Because of that, I asked my other brother (17M) to help install a lock on my bedroom door. But the 28-year-old brother broke in using scissors and took back a Christmas/birthday gift he had given me.

So I removed all his things from my room.
Now I’m wondering—AITA (Am I the Ahole) for not letting him keep his stuff in my room anymore since he doesn’t respect my privacy?"
467,1jsensn,Not the A-hole,AITA- my dad promised to help my son get his first car but it's a 🍋lemon,"4 years ago, my dad helped my oldest daughter get her first car. For context, my mom (they were still married at the time of her passing) had died just a few months prior. 

He gave her $5000, and then gave my second oldest $5000 towards her first car in the same transaction. Both my brother and I were witness to it. My brother asked if this was something dad was going to do for all his grandkids (Between my brother and I, there are 6 grandkids). Dad said he would be happy to. This was in 2021.

Now, he is not uber rich, but he is very well off, and the grandkids are spread out age wise, so it's not all coming at once. 

Fast forward to now. My son is saving for a car. Grandpa gets wind of it and says to keep him in the loop, as he would like to help. Great! Grandpa starts the hunt for a reasonable first car and the first one he finds is an older Toyota that sounds like a good deal. This is where it gets sticky. 

Grandpa calls us all excited, this car is a dream boat! Great shape, no rust, owned by and serviced regularly by a mechanic. Ticket price is $3900. He then proceeds to offer to pay half. Wait, what? Oh fine. Half is better than nothing. 

So he buys the car in my name, so it's titled to me etc. and we agree to meet up the next day to exchange. Son brings the $1000 he saved, we put up the other 1000 and go pick it up. After I hand my dad the cash, then he tells me the check engine light is on, but the dealer ran a codecheck and we just need to replace an O2 sensor. No biggie, but we are irritated, because who tf buys a car when the check engine light is on? Now this is a project. Dad says find out the cost to fix it, and we'll split it halfsies.

We get home and have our good friend who is a mechanic run the code check again. Turns out, the catalytic converter is shot and will need to be replaced immediately. What was a <$100 problem is now a $900 problem. We call to let my dad know, and now he's all ""Does son have any skin in this? He should chip in""

My guy, you bought a somewhat shitty car for your grandson that you promised, but expect him to fix it? WTF? AITA for expecting him to stick to what he promised? AITA for being mad that he stuck us with a $1000 repair, even though he helped buy the car?

ETA: Dad's a pretty solid gear head. We have worked on cars together. I was pretty surprised that he drove a car with the check engine on off the lot without further inspection

468,1jsekc6,Everyone Sucks,AITA for asking my roommate to stop bringing her bf over after just one week?,"I (21F) live in a house with my roommate (also 21F) who I've known since elementary school. We’ve been family friends for years, and I was lucky to have struck an agreement with her parents to share an off-campus space that they own. My monthly rent is a bit high for our area but I was ok with it only being the two of us in the entire house with an agreement that this would serve as our safe space. So no parties, bringing in people we were unfamiliar with, or doing anything that would potentially cause disruptions to our everyday lives. If we wanted to bring visitors, we would always communicate it. It’s a little conservative for college living, but I never had an issue with it. I was more than happy to hang out at a friend's place or elsewhere.

About a week ago, she texted me asking if her new boyfriend could ""stay over."" At the time, I thought she meant just visiting during the day, so I said yes after a bit of fun teasing. Later, I realized she meant overnight, and I clarified that I wasn’t comfortable with that. I've had some negative past experiences with men, and even if her boyfriend hasn't done anything, the presence of a man I don't know in the house overnight triggers my anxiety and affects my sleep and well-being. She apologized and said he’d only be in her room and didn't think it would make me super uncomfortable.

But since then, he's been here *every single night*. Two nights after we texted, I heard them getting intimate through our thin walls after being awoken by my door and bedframe shaking at 2 AM. I haven't had a good night's sleep since. I have been lying awake until 4 or 5 AM on edge and constantly on alert to every noise. Perhaps this sounds dramatic, but I don't like feeling constantly jumpy and tense in what’s supposed to be my safe space.

I've tried to gently hint my discomfort, but now she only tells me he'll be over when I ask, at which point I get a ""yeah, is that ok?"" when they've already planned his stay. He's now at our house more often than me, the actual tenant. When I asked her why she doesn't go to his place (with no roommates) she laughed and said ""I just don't feel like driving.""

Now, I don't feel safe or comfortable with him here *at all*, not just for overnights, but even for day visits. I feel like asking her to stop having him over entirely is the only way I can get my peace of mind back, but I'm worried she'll think I'm overreacting or controlling. I don't want to talk to her parents either even though they're the homeowners and helped set the original expectations. I don’t want to make her feel like I went behind her back.

It’s only been a week, and I know it hasn't been months, but I'm mentally and physically exhausted. It's getting difficult to focus in my classes during the day. I'm also in the middle of finishing my final required courses for my degree, and I can't afford to let this affect my academics right now. Is it fair to ask her to stop bringing him over entirely? AITA?"
469,1jse0g9,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to help my mom?,"I have always had issues with my mom since I was little. She is an alcoholic. We’ve always had financial troubles and constantly moving from home to home, moments where I couldn’t get the emotional support that I needed, etc. I think you get the point. 
  
My mom quit working a couple of years ago to pursue a music career. I have expressed to her that it isn’t a good idea and that she should focus on getting back into her previous career, but she refused. Since then, she has been struggling with money and drinking excessively at the bars that she performs at. I have tried to help her for many years and she would not accept my help and since then, I had made the decision (with the help of my therapist) that I will be low contact with her and will not help her if she doesn’t go to rehab and starts seeing a therapist. 
 

Three years ago, my dad passed away and he ended up leaving me and my siblings his house and car. His car has been an issue since we received it. His didn’t have it registered in his name and the courts have yet to give us the title since they lost his paperwork and we had to redo his entire probate case. My mom called me today and she was crying and pleading for me to give her my dad’s car. She says that she needs it for her to be able to continue her music career but the car isn’t registered in our names as of yet. I have explained this to her and she got really angry with me, accusing me of hating her and not wanting to help her after everything she did for my siblings and I. I acknowledge and appreciate all that my mom has done for my siblings and I tremendously but my mom wasn’t there for me as much as I was there for her. The issues in her life are of her own making and I feel like if I help her, she will only make things worse for herself. I don’t know if it’s right whether or not I help her but I don’t want to continue this constant cycle of her asking for my help, throwing all she did for me at my face, and then going back to drinking and singing at bars. I don’t see my therapist for another couple of weeks and my guilt is eating me alive at this situation.. AITA? "
470,1jse061,Not the A-hole,AITAH for talking back to my parents for the first time?,"

I(17m) talked back to my parents for the first time in my life. So a lil backstory here, ever since I was a kid I've been a very shy and introverted and never talked back or argued with my parents ever, they tell me to sleep, I sleep, they tell me to eat I eat, and this has literally been my life all together, and recently I feel like I don't even have a life anymore because of this. I turned 17 a month ago and my parents still treat me like a child, I wake up pretty early (I had holidays for 2 weeks) around 6-7 and yk brush my teeth take a bath blah blah the usual, after that I go for a run, gym and reach back home. Once I'm home I start studying cuz my senior year of high school and attend few extra courses and prepare for a competition coming up and play basketball in the weekend. Throughout this entire routine my parents control me like a robot telling me to do all of this and the only way I get any sort of entertainment or have literally any kind of fun is play basketball in the weekend IF I get time. I sleep at 10 and my mum takes away my phone and she literally only gives it to me for like an hour to look at imp messages from school or tuition. At this point I'm kinda fucking mad and I'm lil fed up. I can't go out with friends barely go to any birthday parties, have no social life outside of school even though I have plenty of friends, I'm tired. So 2 days back I was in my room studying at around 10 30 when my dad comes up and says as usual to hand over the phone (even though I just got it) and I literally just crash out at this point, I get up and I scream No, and I keep saying stuff along the lines of I'm fed up and I ain't giving you shit (all in my native Lang) and that literally scares the shit out of my dad and mum who was behind him, and Im a pretty decently athletic and tall dude im like 6'2 compared to my dad who's barely 5 8 and mum who's around 5'2. So I say all of this and shut the door and go to sleep, and ever since then my parents haven't talked to me and my mum keeps saying to other relatives that I'm corrupted or I'm getting bad influence from my friends at school and they keep saying I don't love them n shit like that.

471,1jsd80r,Not the A-hole,AITA for helping a kid?,"So I'm at my son's judo lesson, it has endend and we are in the changing room, my son (5 yo) is finishing getting dressed and for the last at least 3 minutes, I keep hearing a kid crying and calling ""mom, mooom"" but I don't see him. My son is ready and as we get out, in the opposite changing room I see one of his classmates from school that is also in the judo lesson. Tuns out he is the kid who has been crying. Now I know him because he is in the same school as my son and also because I often accompany my son's class when they go on field trips, so I often help with shoes or jackets or whatever, and also the kid knows me. The mom knows who I am as well. The kid is sitting on the floor looking scared, crying for his mom while getting dressed, so I stand to his level and ask him what is going on. He tells me ""mom is gone, mom is gone"". Now even though we are the only people in the changing rooms, his 4 year old sister is sitting next to him and she doesn't seem worried at all, so I tell him that I don't think his mom is gone and I try to reassure him. While I am talking I see that he is putting his shoe on the wrong foot so I tell him that but he doesn't hear me, because he is crying, so I take the shoe off his foot, and I start fixing the sock that he had put upside down, when his mother arrives and tells me (in an angry way) not to do it, that he has to do it by himself, she had told him that she was leaving so that he hurried because he is always so slow, he is 6 and he should dress by himself etc. I immediately apologize, of course the mom was there and she didn't abandon her kids but I admit I didn't really think and couldn't ignore a kid who was scared and crying alone. I really do hate interfering with other people's parenting. I tell her what happened and I keep on apologizing but she seemed really upset. After some thought maybe I shouldn't have touched her kid.

473,1jsd03f,Asshole,AITA for putting my Step Sisters cat in its cage?,"Me and my wife have recently divorced. I have fallen into a deep depression because she cheated. So, my Mom and my Step Dad (my bio parents split) planned for me and my daughter to visit them in Arizona. I live in California so its not that far away. 

For context, my daughter is highly allergic to cats and my Step Sister has one. 

So we get there and what do we see in the window? A CAT. My daughter (lets call her Amy, shes 8) started crying and said ""can we go back home please daddy?"". My step sister was gone w/ her friends so I left my daughter outside for a second while I put the cat in its cage. I washed my hands, went back outside to get my daughter. I had her sit in the guest room while me and my mom (step dad was showering) put sheets on everything. Apparently, she forgot to tell me that Step sis had a cat.

So anyways, Step sis comes home and sees her cat in the cage. She absolutely loses it. Screaming even starts crying. Says her cat hates being the cage (then why have one?). Mom tries acting like she isn't taking sides but its clear she is on Step Sisters side. I ended up leaving the next day because they were being very annoying. Now, they are all blowing up my phone telling me I ruined everything and my daughter was completely fine. I blocked their numbers for now, but I need outside opinions. "
474,1jsc7re,Not the A-hole,AITA for going to the movies with my friends instead of my gf,"For context, my friends and ive been planning to see a movie for over a year now, and it has just come out. My gf wants to see that movie with me too, but she only wants it to be the two of us. She doesnt wanan go with my friends. Weve been together for over 5 months now, and i javent met her a year before. I get why shes mad at me but i havent seen my friends in months and weve been planning this for a year. I wanna go with her too but i feel like i have an obligation to go with my friends since i promised them. 

I think im probably right in this but i still have a stomach ache and now i dont wanna go because shes sad that im not going with her. Only problem is i cant turn back now, since the movie is tmrw ive ordered our seats online already.

Edit: thanks everyone for the replies. I read all of them. The rrason shes like this is because (1) a classmate of her tried to SA her in middle school (it was another girl), (2) bc she used to have a girlfriend, whom she met online who was so emotionally manipulating, and not like this, more like 1 time she was so nice and lovey dovey  and then next she called her the shittiest person ever. Also constant verbal abuse from her parents for years. She needs to go to therapy, weve taljed abt that before, but we just dont have money for it. Im going to see the movie, and if she brings it up again im telling her the arguments you all made. Seriously thank you.

Edit2/UPDATE: i posted this right before going to bed yesterday and it looks like she came to her senses afterall, without me talking to her. Im happy abt it. I mean i can sense shes kinda said but kike she accepted that im going to do this now. Thanks again yall"
475,1jsb6ay,Everyone Sucks,AITA for not letting my boyfriend use my phone charger?,"I just have had so many problems with people borrowing my charger, or mixing up the charging cable “accidentally”, so then my charger doesn’t work anymore. I just don’t want to deal with this, especially in my own house with my boyfriend! I wrote my name on the charger so he knows he should use the other two (his own obviously, or the charger for my tablet; the tablet one I care less so he can use. But don’t touch my phone charger)

So today I go in my room and cannot see my charger in its designated space, I go and ask him and he says he had to use the cable and now it’s downstairs. Mistake one: don’t use my fucking charger. Also why the fuck do I need to go downstairs to get my OWN charger, put it back to its place, you just made me walk for nothing, this was mistake two. & I go downstairs and I see two random charging cables on the couch, no idea which one was originally mine, which is mistake three: why did you mess up the cables and how will I know which one was mine. 

I’m so frustrated and I get even more frustrated because people seem to be fine with these things. So I went and told him this and he says it doesn’t matter which cable was mine. What….. am i the asshole? "
476,1jsanl2,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my sister I don't want to invite her in my home.," A little bit contexts, my sister (26F) and I (22F) have never been close, between the ages of 10 and 18 she used me to lie to my parents when she went out on the sly, asked me for money every week (money she has never paid back, she owes me approximately 600 euros now) and rejected me when I tried to get closer to her. She always spoke badly to me, insulted me and else, fortunately it never came to blows.

 2 years ago I went to live in another country, I met my fiancé there and we came back to live near my parents, I found a job that wasn't very rewarding, bu it was just until I started my studies again. As my job is a 40-minute walk from home and I don't have a car, I sometimes ask people to give me a lift home in the evening, as I don't feel safe going home alone at night. One day I asked her and she said yes without any complains
 That was 4 months ago, and I haven't asked her again since.


 Tonight, my mum came over because she was next door, and she suggested she picked me up from work, I said yes. I was surprised to see my sister in the car, but I didn't have any particular feelings about it. We were chatting and suddenly my sister asked me why I never invited her to my house. I told her that she'd never invited me to her place either, and she retorted that 1 month ago she'd asked me once to come and eat at her place with my parents (in reality it was my mother who sent me a message to say that she was eating at my sister's and to ask me if I'd like to come, to which I replied no, as my partner was very ill), so I told her that if she wanted to come over she could, all she had to do was send me a message. She said no, it should be up to me. I'm someone who doesn't like sending messages, I'm a bit shy so I don't often talk to my other brothers and sisters. 


My sister and I have nothing in common (no hobbies, no friends in common, nothing) so I don't send her any messages and she doesn't send me an. She then told me I should make an effort. I told her that the phone works both ways and that the last thing I want to do after getting home from work in the evening is to invite someone I don't have nothing to do with, over to my place. I also told her that we were never close and that I didn't really see any problem with that, no-one is obliged to be in a constant relationship with someone, family included. She didn't speak after that. My mother asked me to apologise by message after I'd gone home. 

Was I too blunt, too mean? It was the first time I'd ever tolked back to her and I don't know if I did is wrong, all I know is it felt good not backing up for once. 
Am I the Asshole?"
477,1jsahbb,Not the A-hole,AITA for reacting to a rude message from a neighbor,"I recently started renting in an apartment building (some months now) . A neighbor of mine (apartment above mine) posted a note in the elevator (!), saying that he heard laughter late at night. The post was made in a rude fashion (the expressions I mean), he weirdly put his name under and the floor and signed it (!) .He didn't tell us anything , didn't knock , didn't ask to be quiet .He didn't use the notice board ( like to be more discreet). He didn't use the manager of the building because we called her to find about it. Using her as a mediator, I mean.It all had a feeling of publicly trying to shame the people who ""did it"".
It didnt say specifically our name but it kinda described us , we are the closest apartment to him. It also could have been us cause we laugh like in general , I don't know what day he means though.

Now to give a bit more context he has a family with children and they make hella lot of noise.
Screaming children,  parents shouting at them , using inappropriate expressions like ""it's my house, and you can do whatever you want when you turn 18"" that we can clearly hear downstairs. Running all the time!!!
I didn't think talking to them but after his notice, I posted also a notice saying that he really should also stop his house noise , since he wishes such strict rules around.

He came the same day to my apartment holding the paper in the air. Saying that I got some nerves for saying that, because their noise is during ""appropriate noise hours"", that I don't have children that's why I don't know (which I find very rude tbh) , that other people had complaints ( we didn't know about it neither did the manager). He contradicted himself because at one time he said ""other people told me it was you"" and the other time he said "" I didn't know who it was"". 🤔 

I told him that it really makes no sense he complaing about noise when he produces it nearly all the time . It really doesn't matter that it's during the whole day and not at night which is what he says , you finish the day totally annoyed especially when you happen to be at home during the whole day.

He says that was my “job”. I have paid him back some of what I have owed him in cash. That was a big mistake being I didn’t think I would have to make receipts at the time thinking he was my friend back when I paid him. Now he says I didn’t pay him. Now I feel I know the situation between us I have to go way beyond to document my cash payments to him being paper receipts and video testimony from him so he will not have a way of doing so again. I know I owe him money but can not get a total amount from him on what I owe. Am I the ass hole for refusing to pay him back when it’s not stated the amount owed? I will pay him when he gives me the total amount owed. I fell otherwise I’m paying into an endless pit. He has asked me every time I try to get a total amount from him what I think is owed. When telling him he always claims it’s too low. What should I do and am ITAH
479,1jsaero,Asshole,AITA for telling my friend she should try thinking before speaking?,"
I and my friend have been online friends for about 5 years. Usually, we get along well and rarely argue. We’re both stubborn and very opinionated but when we don’t agree on something we often leave it to simple disagreements.

However, the times we have argued have usually been because of a comment(s) she’s made that I feel are either very ignorant and insensitive or overall just out of touch. Some of her comments have been so inappropriate that they’ve made me have to take a break from talking to her and question who this person is that I’m friends with. She’s made racist comments, predatory comments, and even very elitist comments.  Every single time she backtracks claiming she didn’t mean it that way. 

Today I sent a video that popped up on my feed to our group chat followed by a racist comment directed at POC. She commented that it wasn’t racist, it was just funny. Mind you she’s white. She then backtracks trying to explain what racism “actually is” and it didn’t matter and couldn’t be offensive  because “no one was being treated differently.”   After getting into it she backtracks claiming she didn’t mean to sound that way. I told her she has a habit of making gross ignorant comments and should learn how to think before speaking. Am I the asshole? "
480,1js9woz,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I block my sister from buying a house for my parents?,"My parents are retired and have been living in the same house for the past 20 years. It was my grandfather’s house and when he passed away my parents moved in and finished paying off the mortgage so they own it outright. Recently they decided to sell the house and move closer to their children.

My sister and her husband have an LLC they use for their side businesses, and I found out that my sister is planning to buy the house for my parents under the ownership of her LLC and my parents will pay the mortgage (including taxes and insurance) to the LLC. My sister asked the siblings if we have an issue with it; my other two siblings said they were fine with it but I don’t like the idea (I haven’t said anything yet). 

Personally I don’t see any benefit to this arrangement for anyone other than my sister and her husband. The negatives I see are:

1. My parents will make a decent profit off the sale of their house and my understanding of the tax laws are that if the money is reinvested then you don’t pay taxes on the profit, but if you don’t, then you owe income tax on it.

2. The property taxes will continue to increase causing the monthly payment to go up each year. My parents are of the age where they can lock in their property taxes, but they will not be able to freeze the taxes in this arrangement because they won’t be the owners.

3. (I hate even thinking about this one) Someday my parents are going to pass away, and when they do, all of the equity they have paid into the house will be my sister’s. If my parents bought the house themselves, then the equity would be an asset to be divided amongst their beneficiaries, so the rest of us are losing out on this portion of the inheritance. The only advantage to the arrangement is that when they pass, my siblings and I won’t have to figure out what to do with the house.

I know my parents and my sister are on board with this arrangement and my other siblings seem to not have a strong opinion. If I say something then it’s definitely going to cause tension between us all, but if I don’t, then my parents will be paying more money than they need to, and the other siblings and I will be losing $25-75k each out of the inheritance. And since I’m the only one who hasn’t given the okay, I’m either outvoted or I end up changing peoples minds and blowing the whole thing up, either way there will be resentment and drama."
481,1js894p,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for snapping at my future MIL?,"For context I am  22f and my fiancé is 24m. We met in highschool and have been together for about 7 years now since. I met my future MIL (I will be calling her FMIL) about a few weeks-a month after we got together.

 At first things didn't seem too bad. She seemed obsessed with my fiancé and his life almost but I looked past it and was still nice to her. Little did I know things were gonna get WEIRD. Throughout our relationship FMIL has done some weird unusual stuff that I have just come forward with. Examples of these being tracking my period to check if I was pregnant and even talking actively with her friends about mine and his sons ""sex life"" (we haven't done anything at that time since we were both focused on school. She assumed this stuff). I have told her before that stuff made me uncomfortable and especially being in school I was focused on graduating. My fiancé and I have tried setting boundaries and even going low contact due to reasons for her saying stuff to my mother about my brother (my brother has passed away. She said to my mom in anger that her son wanted distance that ""just because your son is dead doesn't mean you can take mine away from me"") 
My FMIL and being told no/called out on some of her actions kinda reacts like a toddler and will talk crap and retaliate. When my fiancé first went low contact she got her friends to harass him at his job and even me out in public.

 We are now currently on terms where we can talk  and be in the same room but not often. Of course despite all of that stuff that has happened, she still doesn't respect boundaries. She goes as far as to try to kiss her son (my fiancé) on the lips and try to talk about our private intimate life and having kids. She is telling me on how I should parent when I have kids and how she wants to be the one to watch them and overall is pushing us to have kids. We don't have kids and want to wait due to personal health and career reasons. I have stated this before but every time I'm around her she says it. Lately when we've been alone without my fiancé she mentions girls she thinks would be better for him. 

Well this past time we saw her at a dinner (her, my future FIL, fiancé, and myself) and she mentioned wanting grandkids and how she wanted to spoil them and be there for when I ""give birth"". She also mentioned my family in a negative way and something in me snapped and I started to get extremely snappy and told her how she wasn't respecting my boundaries or me and it shows that she doesn't care. She went silent but gave me a dirty look and I walked away into the other room where my fiancé and his father were (they didn't hear a thing somehow). When we were eating she was only talking to everyone but myself and would not address me unless the other two talked to me. She didnt talk to me for a day or two but now seems on ok terms with me and hasn't done anything weird so far.

Did I take it too far with snapping at her? AITA?



TL;DR My mother in law doesn't respect me and I snapped at her.



Edit/Update: thank you everyone for the advice, I talked to my fiancé and we had a discussion about his mother's actions and decided we will be going low contact and only speaking if needed at family functions/outings. We discussed that WHEN we have kids that she will not be allowed in the room with us and she will wait until we are ready for her to meet said child. He told me he's always been uncomfortable with his mother doing this stuff and has talked to her before but she never has listened. He came out and told me that he has been emotionally and mentally abused by his mother and has even been manipulated/gaslit on his own feelings and so he has had a hard time enforcing boundaries with her. So we made a plan to make a list of boundaries and talk with her about them and enforce them whether she likes it or not (respectfully obviously). I encouraged him that his and my boundaries are important so he so far is starting to become more confident with himself because of it. As for our wedding him and I decided that when we do we have designated people who will act as security and shut down any drama that may be started by her. I appreciate all the advice and support given! 🫶🫶"
482,1js86ei,Everyone Sucks,AITA for waking up my roommate?,"My roommate and I have had some issues lately. Basically Ive been getting back to my dorm later in the night (on average around 1:30am maybe 2am once a week towards the end of the week). For context my roommate and I were friends a semester before I moved in with her so shes not *just* a roommate and weve been living in the same dorm for about 3 semesters. She is also friends with my older sister.

I recently became friends with a much larger group and we've been hanging out a lot. At first my roommate would text me asking where I am and when I'm planning to be back. Shed usually ask this around 10pm or 11pm but I dont get back to her until maybe an hour later because I'm hanging out with friends and she gets upset with me for not answering sooner. One night I didnt get back until really late and she had a panic attack because I wasnt responding and she reached out to my sister who was able to give her my location. After that I gave her my life360 so she always knew where I was to avoid giving her another panic attack.


After that she started asking me more frequently when I planned on being back after hanging out with friends and Id give her a general time frame but I always ended up staying later than the time I gave her. I never really wanted to stay out till 12am but I was having fun and I felt pressured to give her an earlier time than I wanted. Its gotten to the point where I dread coming back to my dorm because I know shes going to be mad at me. She also did this weird thing for a while where she seemed upset that I didnt invite her to this hangout I had with my friends but she doesnt really know them, theyre like separate friend groups and I thought it was odd. Occasionally shell make jokes where I think this might not be entirely about me coming back late and more of an attachment issue thing. She does say regulalry that I'm her best friend and that she doesnt want me to leave her and that shes glad I tolerate her which set off a red flag in my mind. 


I'm really not trying to wake her up because I do feel bad about it but because shes such a light sleeper theres not much of a difference between me getting back late and me waking up in the middle of the night to pee. I'm actually more disruptive when I get up to pee because I have to open the door twice instead of once and sometimes I avoid getting up to pee if I hungout with friends that night because even though theyre separate reasons for being up, I feel like she'll blame it on me being out late with friends. I really am doing everything I can to not wake her up but if me walking past her bed in the middle of the night wakes her up theres really not much I can do? Like its college, I should be able to stay up late hanging out with friends without my roommate hounding me, shes not my mom and I'm 20 years old, I dont need to be checked on everytime I'm out late and have her get upset with me because I dont respond right away.

483,1js7ogt,Everyone Sucks,AITA for relying on my parents financially after college?,"I (24M) graduated college in 2022. I was very successful in college and actually had a job working *for* my university after I graduated. Unfortunately, I have severe IBS, and my symptoms began to dramatically worsen to the point that I couldn't work most days. I won't get into it here but it was almost-hospitalized bad. I couldn't afford to keep paying rent, so after about six months at my job, my parents told me to quit and move back home. Since then these symptoms have gotten a lot better with treatment.

The problem is that I am now unemployed. I've submitted hundreds of applications and had only six interviews. I had a very brief stint as a canvasser for a nonprofit but due to my health issues, I really can't do work that requires me to be away from immediate restroom access. I can work while managing my symptoms at a desk job or in an office, but not while walking around a neighborhood door-to-door.

Through all of this, my mental state has been... Less than stellar. I'm very isolated and have no friends. I have no car. I don't have the money to go out to meet new people. The only social interaction I get is with my family, and we've always had a very difficult relationship due to how strict they were with me growing up. My parents say that I'm lazy, entitled, and selfish for ""mooching"" off of them. They think that I should have already been supporting them financially and paying them back for the Parent PLUS loan they took out to put me through college.

They also patently refuse to buy me basic necessities. I have to borrow money from friends for the medication I need to function. I also have a lot of food sensitivities due to my IBS, and they refuse to buy food that I can eat. They actually go out of their way to make sure that most of the food that they buy is stuff I can't eat, and then my father gloats about ""how much it must suck"" not to be able to eat that food.

My parents say that it should be enough that they let me live here. Any time I bring up even the tiniest issue, they hold the fact that they can evict me and make me homeless at any time over my head. Any and all financial problems or stressors are automatically blamed on me, and any time I ask for anything I'm told I'm being ""selfish"" and that they can't afford it. Meanwhile they eat out four times a week and my dad just bought himself a new motorcycle. Their reasoning is that it's their money and they shouldn't have to spend it taking care of a grown adult. I wish they *didn't* have to, but I just have no other options at the moment.

I keep telling them that if I didn't have to spend so much time struggling to get basic necessities, I would be better able to focus on getting a job or applying to grad school. But living with them mostly alone for two years has left me doubting if what I ask of them is too much. I genuinely don't know anymore if I'm being selfish for asking for these things or feeling upset about the way they treat me. So I figured I'd ask this here. Reddit, AITA?

EDIT: Since some folks have implied that I'm complaining about ""tummy aches"", at my worst (tw: emetophobia) >!I was throwing up multiple times a day and unable to keep even water down!< . I lost 20lbs in a week due to being unable to eat. It was bad. I'm well-treated now and have things mostly under control but at the time when I quit my job I was almost hospitalized.

EDIT 2: Thanks to everyone offering advice. I'll definitely look into financial support programs again."
484,1js70hx,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving party,"Hi, 

I have depression and anxiety so really struggle to get my self out at the moment. I was invited to a party today, the weather was nice and a friend came with me on public transport so was feeling pretty good. Friends are aware I been struggling so was a chill environment.

 Party went well for first few hours, I wanted to have a sit down so I asked the hosts boyfriend (who was laying across the sofa) if he could move over a little bit so I can sit down on the end.He looked me dead in the eye and said 'no you fat cunt', in front of other people but idk how many people heard as no one said anything. 

I'll be honest I wanted to chuck my drink in his face but I hate confrontation so I just smiled, quietly went off and got my bag and jacket and left. I then got a message from the host who is a good friend of mine, asking why I have left and that her bf was 'only joking' and she said she's upset that I left.

 Did I overreact and become the AH by leaving? "
485,1js5g85,Not the A-hole,AITA for arguing with my friend because of the time it took for a drink to be made?,"My friend and I had just finished a movie with some other friends and one of them had to pick up something she had brought, earlier which I didn't mind since she had already paid for it, although it took a while after a little bit she came back since she couldn't find the shop where she got the thing from earlier so my friend (the one who got mad at me) went with her to find it. I was thirsty so I went to buy myself a drink since I assumed they would take a long time, like they did before so I went to the counter and ordered and a while after my friend came back. My drink hadn't been made yet so my friend started getting annoyed at me since it was taking a while so I was sitting waiting and I could see that she was rolling her eyes and just being condescending, honestly. I admit that I didnt handle this in the calmest manner but I told her to stop rolling her eyes at me and she said something to do with being annoyed and we got into a bit of a argument nothing hurtful was said just normal arguing but she stormed off and said something along the lines of ""Fine, then find a way, to get yourself home"" because her father was supposed to drop me off at home and she left me (I'm am a minor btw) alone in a crowded mall, by myself but eventually after I called my grandma to tell her the situation, which got her stressed out our other friend came out and took me back to the car and I couldn't get my drink either, for which I had paid 7.80 dollars. I understand where she was coming from and why she was upset and admit the argument was stupid, but I just need an outside opinion AITA?"
486,1js59cq,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking for my money back,"So I never post here but I need to know if I'm wrong or not

I 36F, used to live with my cousin 43M, the lease was under my name, it was a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment, we each paid half of the rent and it was decided that he would be paying for the internet and cable since he was working from home and he was the only one who actually watched TV. We also had his 20 something year old son living with us and he helped with the bills as well. It was also decided that I would be the one cooking every meal since he was the one was going to be buying groceries 

My cousin has a better paying job than me, however he borrowed money from me all the time, granted I also asked him for money every now and then but I always payed him and most of the time it was only uber money.

Before we moved out he asked to borrow $600 then another $300 and I was also paying his mom credit card because he had maxed it out. He told me he was gonna pay him as soon as he got his tax returns, which I was ok with

We lived together for almost 2 years until I decided to move in with my boyfriend this January. We spent almost $900 to move out and he asked me to pay half of it, I told him to just deduct it from the amount he owed me but he insisted that I had to pay which I did. 

We moved our stuff to a storage unit and that's about $220 a month, he has asked me to pay for half of it. 

My boyfriend and my mom are telling me to not pay anything and that he should be the one paying for everything since he owes me more money 

AITA for not paying the storage and telling my cousin to either pay me or he can pay the storage with the money he owes me "
487,1js4unp,Not the A-hole,AITA for being ungrateful about getting a kitten,"My sibling (14) and I (F17) have always wanted a cat but due to money/living situations, it wouldn't have been responsible for our family to get one (I had to argue with my parents about this). In the past year, we've moved to a proper house but we still have a few non urgent renovations that we need to do. 

I had originally had an appointment this morning that was cancelled for reasons, when my father had, seemingly jokingly, showed me a listing for some kittens for sale and that he had already paid for one. I was completely unaware that he was looking for one but apparently he had told everyone but me. I told my parents how high maintenance kittens were, the vaccinations/vet appointments we would need. However, they said I was being overdramatic and that the cat can just be left alone for hours and my sibling could just do all of the work. My mum even joked about how they could just release the cat if it was too much work.

My parents work most of the day (afternoon to night) and my sibling has school. My sibling leaves dishes on the table, food scraps on the floor, doesn't do any of the chores... and my parents think that they can take care of a kitten?

Im at home most of the time doing school work, so I would have to take care of the cat. I currently have A level exams and plan to go to uni in September, so I'm too stressed and don't have the time to. I also have a part time job, and driving test soon.

My parents argue that they let me have a pet snake (they're generally 'low maintenance' and my family dont help me take care of it, which is fine. I pay for everything for my snake apart from electricity) so they should be allowed to have a cat, and that I'm being selfish.

Am I being too pessimistic and ungrateful? I feel like I should be, but I really don't feel ready getting a cat at this point of my life. I really dont think my sibling (or me) is mature enough to care for the cat alone. I get that it's 'their house and money, their decision' though.

TLDR: Family kept me in the dark about getting a kitten. I would be left to care for the kitten mainly, while also preparing for my exams. I would've loved to have a kitten, but just not at this point in my life.

Thank you!"
488,1js4l16,Not the A-hole,AITA for not attending my own 18th birthday dinner?,"I (18) had my birthday a little over a month ago, but recently had a conversation with my dad that made me wonder whether or not I'm the AH. (potentially relevant, I'm autistic so I'm not sure whether there's something I'm missing here) 

On the day of my birthday, I had a meeting for an extracurricular after school. At the time, I didn't have my license, so I relied on my girlfriend for a ride home after the meeting (she's also a part of the club). My mom, who'd been sick, texted me as we were leaving the school that she and my stepdad wouldn't be coming because they didn't want to expose anyone to whatever she had, and that we would have dinner together at a later point. I then texted my dad that we'd have to reschedule because my mom's sick.

My wonderful girlfriend decided to take me to get fast food so we could do something small to celebrate, and about 5 minutes later we were pulling into the parking lot and he called me. He immediately started yelling at me that I was horrible for canceling and that they were already at the restaurant, saying that ""that's not how you treat people"", and that even though my mom and stepdad couldn't take me to the restaurant (about 30 minutes from our house), I could just tell my girlfriend to drop me off. I just listened to him yell for a couple minutes, said ""Okay"" and hung up, and texted him an apology for canceling. 

I felt it would be unfair to ask her to drop me off there because of how far it was, especially on such short notice. (This isn't the first or last time he's expected my girlfriend to drive me around places, last week he got angry over a miscommunication over where they'd pick me up from and decided to let me ""find my own way home"", knowing my girlfriend was with me. His house can be an hour and a half away from my school with usual traffic) I sat in the car for 20-30 minutes in silence trying to process what had happened and my girlfriend went to get our food. 

Fast forward to this week, my dad and I had a conversation in which he talked about how that day was the biggest betrayal he's ever experienced and how he sat in the restaurant crying, because his oldest child was turning 18 and he wasn't there, that my birthday dinner wasn't for me but for my parents to experience me turning 18, and that he didn't have any interest in going to a new dinner to celebrate. That conversation made me reconsider and wonder if I was the AH in the situation.

Edit to answer some common questions:
1) I knew my mom was sick but assumed that my stepdad was still going and so I would have ride.

2) My girlfriend wasn't invited because we had plans to celebrate with my friends that weekend. She was just going to drop me off at home and my mom and stepdad would drive me to the dinner.

3) My dad said during the recent conversation that when he found out that my mom was sick he planned on picking me up, but he never communicated that to me or my mom."
489,1js4ivg,Not the A-hole,AITA for overstepping,"I would like to preface this by saying I know I did by getting involved in their relationship but only did because my brother did first & tried to fix his mess. 

*The people & relations*: My brother’s girlfriend (F21, let’s call her Alex) & other brother (M21, let’s call him Ben. *Ben is not her boyfriend*) are planning to throw a surprise party for her boyfriend who is our brother (M23, let’s call him Tyler). I’m 27F. 

*The situation*: Ben took it upon himself to invite girls from Tyler’s past to this party. Disclaimer, I am unsure the relation to one but both girls are from 8+ years ago & the other is a fling from 8+ years ago. Alex brought it to my attention (& confided in me) that one of them have been messaging Tyler a few months ago telling him they should hangout. Tyler makes it very known he’s been with Alex for 5 years & she doesn’t how she feels about having these girls come but doesn’t want to create issues with Ben. 

*The outcome*: My boyfriend & my parents all agreed what Ben is doing is wrong & is overstepping. His excuse for it is that he wants to “really surprise” Tyler but with 2 girls from his past when he has a girlfriend of 5 years. Ben no longer talks to me & it’s been 3 weeks & he’s still mad about me basically telling him he’s disrespecting Alex & their relationship.

490,1js4bnc,Everyone Sucks,AITA for leaving a funeral after my cousin was rude to me?,"So about a month ago, I was at my great aunt's funeral (rip she was the best) and I found myself talking to my god-brother, (he is younger than me and is a pre-teen) when another one of my cousins (she's distant) also came over to talk. She repetitivly tried to make my god-brother go with her to go do something and looked like she didn't want to make conversation with me. Finally I was able to make a convo with her and she had the audacity to say stuff like ""Did you know that they glue dead people's eyes shut?"" And ""did you know that they take out all their organs?"" Keep in mind we are at the funeral and that she had just seen me crying earlier -_- Then later I was talking to my god-brother about band (we are both in band, I'm in marching and he's barely beginning) and he was asking for tips on how to fix reeds (a piece of wood that is used for both of our instruments) etc, when she comes again and starts talking about how good she is at singing (she sounds like a frog with the flu) then ""challenges"" me to sing higher than her, well I picked some things up from my friends in choir and ""won"" the ""challenge"". I swear I saw smoke coming out of her ears lol. Then she started talking about how she was born so close to my god-brother (they are the same age) and about how they were basically twins. Then I mention that me and my god-brother's mom (god-Mother) share a birthday, she got mad again and said that not everything was about me and stuff, then when me and my god-brother were giving condolences to my other great aunt, she comes over and yanks him away so they could play tag :/ Later, one of the family members mentioned that my family had helped her a lot (she lived with us since i was born up to until I was 11 but still visited for my birthdays and events) my cousin then went up to me later and started asking ""are you an *insert my last name*?"" I said yes and she looked jealous for some reason, like girl why would you be jealous? She then goes on a rant about how she was closer to my great aunt (still checking if i asked) and so I yelled at her (im not proud of it) and then left home.

 So AITA for leaving a funeral after my cousin decided to be rude to me?
Keep in mind that she is a pre-teen; we haven't really met besides this but we used to have sleepovers when we were little. Also her sister tried to bite me even though she's 9 and I have never done/talked to her."
491,1js4ax2,Not the A-hole,AITA For asking my mom to help me with gas after she called in for me.,"I (20F) and my mom (58F) still live together. One morning I woke up and started getting ready for work. I go into our shared living room to get my shoes front under the bench we have beside the door only the my mom to say “what are you doing?” To which I respond “getting ready for work, why what’s up?” She then says “oh you’re not going today, I called out for you” I thought she was kidding and kind of laughed and getting putting my shoes on. She then says “I’m not joking. I miss seeing you so I told them you were sick” (I wasn’t) Keep in mind we still live together. I responded and said “then how am I supposed to have enough money for gas this week?” To which she responded “I don’t know, figure it out.” At this point I wasn’t very happy especially with that comment. So I asked “are you going to pay me the money I missed out on while not being at work?” To which she responded “no, that is not my responsibility, why would you even ask that? You know how broke we are?” I just stood there kind of dumbfounded. AITA for expecting my mom to help with my gas after she called out of work for me?
Edit: for the people saying I should’ve called them back and told them I would be there. I tried. My mom is best friends and went to school with my head manager. I called and told them I’d be there and was told I was no longer needed that day since my shift had been covered. She called about 2 hours before I had even woke up."
492,1js4a1g,Not the A-hole,AITA for not inviting my dad to my wedding?,"I (23 female) am getting married next year. One of the first things I decided was that I will not be inviting my dad. He was very abusive to my siblings and I as children, and I haven’t seen or spoken to him in years. He doesn’t try to reach out to me either, the only time he calls is to let me know when a family member passes away. My mom passed away when I was 18 and so she obviously won’t be at my wedding either. Some of my family members are saying that I should have at least one of my parents there and that I need to invite my dad. They keep giving me ideas like maybe he doesn’t have to walk you down the aisle, or maybe just invite him to the ceremony, but I just don’t want him there at all. I get that they feel sad for me that my parents won’t be there but honestly I don’t feel sad about it. If he was there, everything would just feel tense and awkward and I don’t want to put my siblings in an uncomfortable situation where they feel like they have to interact with him. As for my mom, the last time I spoke to her was 3 years before she passed and I don’t think I would’ve invited her either if she was alive. I love my mom but she struggled with addiction and was not around very much, I feel like I didn’t really know her that well. My family members seem to be kind of put off by my lack of mournfulness of it all and it makes me feel like an emotionless robot. I just want to enjoy my wedding with the people I genuinely want to spend time with. AITA?"
493,1js48y6,Not the A-hole,AITA For giving my brother his birthday gift before my mom?,"Background: My (F23)  parents are divorced, so we celebrate birthdays at both houses separately. My brother just tuned 17 last week, and we were supposed to celebrate his birthday at my mom's house yesterday. I work Full-Time, but I still live with my mom bc rent in my city is really expensive and I'm trying to save money. My sister (F21) works Part-Time and goes to school. My mom works Part-Time ~1-2 days a week due to her physical and mental health issues.

To celebrate my brothers birthday we were going to see the Minecraft movie and then go to dinner at Outback. We were supposed to leave the house at ~2:00 to go see the movie, but my brother didn't go to bed till 8:30am bc he was up all night on the PS5.
We changed plans to eat dinner first and then go see the movie and at 3:00 my mom told me to wake my brother up to get ready. I wake him up and tell him he needs to shower and get ready and I joke with him that if he gets up and takes a shower I'll give him his present. We'll then my sister (F21) comes in and hands him her gift, which is something small and stupid she got from a claw machine, earlier that day. He actually loved the gift. I had also just gotten his gift that morning as well due to my busy work schedule.
(We both buy him a bunch of stuff throughout year for his video games.)

I didn't get him anything crazy either, just some candy and a cheap headset to have as a backup when he forgets to bring his headset over from his dads. But since my sister gave him her gift, I gave him mine. Well my mom came into the living room and was livid. She called my sister and I jerks and went to her room. My brother went to check on her and she said we weren't going anywhere anymore.

My sister and I were super confused. I think she wanted us to give all give him our gifts at the same time, but that wasn't communicated. We ended up cooking dinner at the house, got a cake from the nearby store, and played video games.

Personally I feel like it was a bit of an over reaction, and at the very least if she was mad at my sister and I, she should have just taken my brother out without us. My sister and I did have to take off work using vacation time to have yesterday off, so we are both a bit irritated.

494,1js444h,Not the A-hole,AITA for the pizza place screwing up the order??,"So I've unfortunately been living with an alcoholic family member who refuses to recognize their problem. I had asked them to help me put a piece of furniture together for my daughter since they're way more mechanically inclined than I am, for payment (mind you, I don't receive payment when I help them do something where I have a strength in that area). I asked them what they wanted in terms of payment, they requested pizza. I helped by handing them the parts and tools they needed, and just provided general companionship and conversation during the process of putting this piece together. Once the job was finished, I thanked them for all their help and work and I went to order the requested pizza (sausage & pepperoni)... and an extra one with the toppings I wanted (sausage and mushroom). When I got home with the pizza, we discovered the restaurant put mushrooms on both pizzas instead of just the one. I apologized for the pizza place screwing up and explained I seriously ordered the one without mushrooms and one with mushrooms and they clearly messed it up. My family member acted like it was no big deal and they would pick them off, so we went about the rest of our day. 

Over the next few days however I started picking up a vibe that they were mad at me. I ended up hearing gossip from another family member that I was being talked about and told that I fucked up the pizza order and did it on purpose just because I know that they hate mushrooms with a passion. (That's the first I had heard they hate mushrooms with a passion also.) I didn't say anything to the Mushroom Hater because a. I knew they're drunk, b. they talk shit about me and other friends and family members quite often, c. they're very finicky and vindictive and selfish ordinarily no matter what. So it gets to be yesterday and I received a volatile text message telling me that I'm ungrateful and rude and selfish for not paying them and that I was the one who had decided on pizza for their payment, not them, and that I'm gaslighting them for not paying them and willing to give them cash.

So, am I really the asshole here for not giving them cash payment instead of an apology for the messed up order?? I really don't feel like I am... I don't feel like I should have had to pay them in the first place, but I also know how I have to bribe this person to get any kind of ""help"" from them no matter what it is. Needless to say, I'll be moving out soon because I'm not putting up with anymore mental and verbal abuse over small, insignificant mix-ups."
495,1js36pd,Everyone Sucks,AITA for not sending my sons pocket money?,"My wife (32f) and I (32m) have 4 children together. The two oldest are 14m and 12m. My wife gives them pocket money at the weekend, not something we have ever discussed or agreed upon. I have no issue, so as long as they have behaved, cool! 
My wife and I work shifts on eachothers days off. Alternating each weekend between us. So the boys have taken to asking me for their pocket money when I'm home. I have no idea what's been agreed by my wife and she doesnt tell me either. She works in a hospital and doesn't have access to her phone for long periods of time. So asking her how much they get, sometimes doesn't get answered until too late in the day for them to go to the shops and buy snacks.

Due to the lack of communication, it has ended up with me getting wrong on three occasions, leading my wife to have a pop at me. First, they had misbehaved and had the pocket money revoked. I wasn't aware, sent them money and wife wasn't happy. Second and third time, they claimed they had done extra housework and Mum had said they could have more. I refused to give the increased amount because I knew nothing of it, wife got miffed again. Boys moping and moaning all day because they didn't get what SHE had promised them. 

So I from that point on, I point blank refused to give them pocket money as it's not agreed or promised by me. Nor am I informed as to how much to whom.

This morning, eldest asks for pocket money and I tell him ""No. I've told you before multiple times, I'm not doing it. It's between you and Mum. Not me"". He messages Mum and she replies through Smart Watch saying ""Show him this message to say I've said yes"". That was all. I refused and have had multiple strongly worded argumentative text messages between wife and me through the day. Me not backing down and firmly standing my ground repeating that its not my agreement, not for me to resolve. Her telling me I'm being ridiculous and to just help out. Still not giving me an amount to send either. Came to a head where she called me to clear the air, I maintained my position, she wants an apology for how I spoke and I am refusing. She wants me to back down and accept that I am being ridiculous and in the wrong. I want her to accept that this is not my situation to resolve, if she wants them to have pocket money, that's for her to sort. Not me.

Yes, I am aware this is petty. Yes, I am aware this has blown out of proportion and caused a lot more stress than is necessary. However, I set a boundary. It has been ignored multiple times and I am sick of being ignored. The final straw.

 So, Reddit Companions, AITA for standing my ground and refusing to send our sons their pocket money?

Fully expecting ESH.

Edit: We are living together. Not separated or divorced. Or close to being either. Due to our own individual circumstances we find confrontation difficult until it becomes so overwhelming that it's unavoidable. Otherwise, we are a very happy healthy unit. The boys are just knobs that ignore instructions 99% of the time and need things repeated constantly to pay attention. 

Situation is now resolved, if anyone can tell me how to lock this now, that would be great thanks!
Cheers for some very amusing and misunderstood responses!

Thank you for those who read fully and replied with logical and reasonable responses!"
496,1js32c4,Everyone Sucks,AITA For constantly asking my sister to repay me,"Earlier in the week my (22F) sister and I (22F) ordered Uber Eats which I paid for. Today, I was doing an Amazon order, and my sister asked if I could get her something in the order. I asked her to send me the £15, and she got really angry at me for asking her to send such a little amount of money – and said I should just pay it for her. She was really condescending and made me feel awful about it.

This has always been a sensitive spot for her – we've had a lot of arguments about this in the past. For reference as well – I'm a student and working a part-time minimum wage job. Money is a HUGE anxiety point for me, and she is very aware of this. She is unemployed, yes, but has been out of Uni for almost a year and has not had a job this whole time as she's been travelling. And, maybe this is a low blow – but she also has a boyfriend with a well-paying job who pays for a lot of her social outings (drinks, food, a few clothing pieces, etc.)

This has happened a lot in the past: once I ended up paying for her and her friends' drinks, around £30 on my sister and her friend – they were asking me to. I texted my sister the total and asked her to send it to her friend – she said she would. A week goes by, I ask again, she says she will. She ends up telling me that she told her friend I'd cover it, as it was EMBARRASSING that I would be chasing people up for such a little amount of money. And she refused to pay me back or tell her friend. Swallowed those costs.

Again – at our birthday party last year, we agreed that we would split the basic costs for food and drinks. I bought a lot of the alcohol that her friends drank. Day after the party, when I asked her to transfer me £100, she said that it was 'in the past now', and she didn't want to spend any more money on the party. I had to get my MOTHER involved. She had a fuss, said I was crazy, etc.

I know it's stingy to ask people to pay you back. I probably wouldn't have asked her to pay me back if it was just the food or the Amazon order. I promise I'm not someone who asks someone to transfer me £3. But this stuff ADDS UP – and the anxiety I get from thinking about how many £10 or £15 I've spent here or there that does not get returned back to me in any way is crazy. Money has a LOT of value to me, especially in this climate where costs are high and wages are low. Sorry if I don't want to offer two hours' worth of work to you. I'm happy to buy my friends a coffee and not expect it in return, and I would never get angry at someone for asking me to transfer them for something – unless it was something I didn't ask for or even like £1.50 (which someone has done to me, and I STILL did it). The shaming and the gaslighting are infuriating me, and it's not just £15, it's £15 on top of everything else I've bought for her that doesn't get returned back.

I don't know. I know everyone thinks of money differently, but this is how I feel, and I kind of feel I have to put my foot down on this. Am I the asshole?"
497,1js2hz1,Asshole,AITA for removing access to certain things for my roommate that refuses to pay rent?,"I'm the only one on the lease and the head of the household. I take care of all the bills, including the late fees when my roommates are late or just refuse to pay.

I have a ""roommate"" that moved in last August to help with rent and other bills. It's now April of the following year with no payments towards rent. She has 3 kids (between the ages of 3 and 8) with 2 different baby daddies, which I'm often not made aware when they're coming to visit despite being told that she needs to tell me beforehand, and she only has the youngest full time. She lost her job shortly after moving in and has since refused to get another one, stating that she can't work and take care of them. In October I gave her a 30 day notice which included a forgiveness for past due rent as long as she left. After the 30 days she stated that she wasn't going to leave and I couldn't make her because ""she's been there long enough"" at that point it was only a couple months. Since then these are the following actions that have been made, to which she has complained about to our other roommate who use to be her friend (he stopped when her actions threatened his housing)

Removing access to our WiFi. To which she stated ""I saw this coming but this affects the kids! What are they gonna do now??""

Removing all the dishes and kitchenware. We paid for them and whenever she did the dishes (or had her oldest do them) there would still be food and grease on them and I'd have to wash them again before even using them.

Removal of the microwave after telling her multiple times to keep it clean especially after her kids use it. It was often disgusting and now hardly works.

She eventually got her own plates and microwave in her room.

We thought about locking the fridge and freezer as our food has gone missing multiple times. Install cameras in our rooms as some small items have also gone missing. Since her refusal to move out she has been banned from dollar general due to theft, refused to find work or follow the rules, has more than tripled our electricity which was $30 prior to her moving in and almost $200 in the winter, wont contribute to anything, and we had to have a fourth roommate move in (which we don't have the space for) just to cover her rent.

My landlord is aware and refuses to take action.

I believe that when you have kids they are entirely your responsibility. They are also the only reason I didn’t take further actions to have her removed in the winter

Due to the kids being involved it has made me feel bad when perusing actions and has been the main reason for the delay of said actions. However they can't be used as a crutch to guilt trip people into allowing you to do whatever you want. And the freeloader has absolutely no remorse for her actions. So AITA for refusing access to certain things for the freeloader? And does anyone have any advice that could help resolve this situation?"
498,1js21tu,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my sister wear my wedding dress for her own wedding,"Basically I am 5 years younger than my sister and we are really close. She came wedding dress shopping with me a few months ago and when I found my perfect dress I bought it but she fell in love with it as well and said things like 
“if you don’t buy this one I’m going to buy it for myself”. 
I ended up buying it not out of spite but because I fell in love with it as well when I tried it on. For context I have been engaged for about 2 years and she’s been engaged for 6 years and hasn’t planned her wedding and has stated she isn’t really interested in getting married as she thinks it’s a waste of money, but will have a micro wedding at some stage. However she has been making jokes about wearing my dress for her own wedding when she decides to get married. I’ve always just brushed them off because I thought she was just joking. But we were on a FaceTime call with my Nana, Mum, myself and my sister and we were talking about how I’m getting the dress altered and my sister was like “no don’t make it shorter I want to be able to wear it.” 
My Nana then chimed in and was like 
“oh that would be beautiful if you let your big sister wear your dress”. 
And I was like 
“uh no, you can find your own dress” and she was like 
“but your dress is my dream dress”. 
After my nana hung up she started asking 
“are you seriously not going to let me wear your dress?” 
And I was like 
“no it’s my dress, I want you to be able to experience wedding dress shopping and try on all different ones because the dresses I thought I liked in photos or on the rack I didn’t when I tried them on it’s a whole experience.” 
Then she was like 
“are you serious?” 
And I was like 
“yes it’s my dress”. 
Then she goes 
“Okay well that’s your decision then and you’ve said no so we won’t talk about it anymore, I will just look at the pictures and remember it’s your dress and no one else’s.” 
Am I the asshole? Am I being too harsh and dramatic about it? I am really upset and everyone thinks I’m being too anal about it because it’s just a dress but it’s my wedding dress. I now feel guilty? I also haven’t had my wedding yet either. "
499,1js1ffe,Not the A-hole,AITA for flaking on my friend’s baby shower?,"
I (31F) have been friends with Alicia (31F) since we were 14. She’s currently pregnant with her second child and invited me to her baby shower. During the planning phase, she even called to discuss potential weekends. I live four hours away, but I was planning to go—I even worked it into our schedule since my husband and I were heading out on vacation the week after, and we planned to stop by the shower on our way (it would’ve added an hour or so to the drive).

Then life happened. My husband’s grandmother passed away the same week as the shower. We had to fly out for the funeral, and by the time we got back, we were already prepping to leave for vacation. The idea of adding more travel and emotional energy into the mix—especially after a death in the family—was starting to feel really overwhelming.

To add to the confusion, Alicia messaged me midweek saying the shower might be canceled due to a family health issue. So for a while, I wasn’t even sure it was still happening.

Here’s where I might be the asshole: I had told her I’d come if she held it, and she ended up going through with it. But the day before, I messaged her and explained that I was really overwhelmed and just didn’t have the mental capacity to make the extra trip with everything going on—funeral, grief, packing, etc. I figured she’d understand.

But… she hasn’t responded since. I’m pretty sure she’s icing me out.

Some context: our friendship has felt really one-sided for years. She’s in medical residency, has a kid, and obviously her plate is full. But she rarely reaches out unless she needs something. I threw her a big, elaborate baby shower for her first child, visited her multiple times in her city, and generally went out of my way to be a good friend. I’ve lived in my city for five years—she’s never visited or even really shown interest in doing so. When I got married (a small ceremony), she didn’t come.

I’m realizing now that I’ve been people-pleasing in this friendship for a long time, and I feel like because I don’t have kids, she expects me to drop everything and be available. But after a week that included a death in the family, anxiety, and general exhaustion, I just couldn’t do it.

So… AITA for flaking?

500,1js19pn,Not the A-hole,AITA for believing people around me,"I’ve been living with the same three roommates in the hostel for the past two years. We’ve had some little fights and disagreements here and there, but honestly, we’re close. We eat together, talk about everything, share things—like a found family kind of vibe.

Now that we’re in our final year and only going to be in college for six months before internships, the idea of moving into a flat came up. At first, it seemed like a natural transition. But suddenly, out of nowhere, I found out—from a mutual friend, not even my roommates—that they were planning to shift to a flat. Apparently, one of them found a flat through a senior, and the three of them had already been talking about it and even went to visit it together. No one had told me anything.

When I brought it up, they said, “Oh, if you want, you can join.” But it honestly felt like an afterthought, not like I was part of the plan from the start.

Later on, they found out the landlord was only okay with three people max in the 2BHK, and any more would either be a problem or come with a heavy rent hike. At that point, two of them had already paid the deposit. For me, I was about 30–40% sure, same with one other roommate. I talked to my mom, convinced her, and she gave me the go-ahead.

When I told the others, they flipped it and said, “Why did you tell your parents when you weren’t even sure of your spot?” And the roommate who also said she was unsure suddenly jumped to “I’m 90% in”—after acting like she was barely considering it. Turns out she had some relative connected to the landlord, so now she’s just securing her position while pretending like she didn’t know all along.

Now they’re making it seem like I was never sure about shifting out, that it’s somehow my fault. One of them even said I should just stay in the hostel or find a flat on my own if my parents allow. Meanwhile, the one who took my ""maybe"" spot keeps asking me what I’m planning to do—as if that matters when there’s no space left for me anymore.

What hurts most is that we were close. We weren’t just roommates—we shared meals, stories, stupid jokes, and support. But in a major decision like this, they just… left me out. Then acted like it was no big deal and flipped the narrative.

Now I don’t even know what to do. If that one roommate ends up backing out, I might have a chance to move in—but I’m honestly torn. Do I go live with them after all this, like nothing happened? Or do I stay back and keep my distance, even though I care about the bond we built?AITA to like trust the ppl around me I've been living for 2 years despite developing ptsd with past roommates and I expect too much out of them or am I overthinking and its not really a deal?

Ps.The other roommate who wasn't sure of shifting still has to initiate a convo to get permission from her dad.
Also ptsd from previous roommates was kinda like they manipulated me into leaving the room because they wanted another friend of mine. And inorder to make me feel like the bad person they sort of didn't talk respond or even utter a letter to me for months so that I'd feel like the wrong person to leave the room tbh."
501,1js0hjs,Not the A-hole,AITA for not helping my mom more with my cousin?,"My(17) aunt recently went to prison for fraud. This put a lot of stress on my mom, who not only has to deal with her older sister being in prison and make sure my grandparents/her parents are handling it okay but has also taken in my cousin(13).

There are two things my mom is concerned about : diet and habit. My cousin eats all the veggies that my mom tells her to but she turns down some of the fruits. She also prefers video games to reading.

At first she only ate apples, bananas and oranges but I was able to convince her to try pomelo, pineapple and melon, and she ended up liking them. So that’s a total of six fruits she eats. My mom asked me to see if I could find books my cousin would enjoy. I ended up getting her hooked on a particular author. She read six of her books and just started the seventh one.

But my mom said it isn’t enough, and that she should eat more fruits and read books by other authors too. I don’t want to push since she’s still processing all the changes that’s happened but my mom accused me of coddling her and said that we’re a family and I should cooperate. That she wants what’s best for my cousin but can’t do everything on her own.

UPDATE : I talked to my mom and told her that I understand she cares about my cousin’s health and well-being, but at 13 she’s already dealing with a lot more than many adults have had to. And that while we are a team right now we should focus more on helping my cousin through all the changes. That the fact she eats all the veggies she’s given and six fruits already gives her a healthy diet so we shouldn’t push. My mom admitted that she’s tried to control the little things because she feels like right now that’s all she could do. She said from now she’ll work on helping my cousin adjust."
502,1jrzums,Not the A-hole,AITA for taking back my MacBook from my wife,"When I left my previous job, to my shock they let me keep my work laptop, a beast of a MacBook Pro. I, however, don’t need a laptop daily and so I proposed a trade with my wife: her old Thinkpad (about 5 years old) for a 1 year old MacBook Pro spec’ed to heaven and back. This was especially driven by the fact she wanted something she could use Adobe and Autodesk on without each action taking forever.

The problem is this, she’s sentimental about the Thinkpad, moreover she required time to move stuff like important documents and passwords over. I “lent” her the MacBook for two weeks to decide if she wanted it and she very obviously did. That was 7 months ago… and she still has both laptops, leaving me with none.

Fast-forward to today, we got in a heated discussion and the takeaway is this: she wants both, her Thinkpad to take about with her (despite her not needing to at all), and the MacBook as a sudo desktop, her argument was that I already have a new work laptop, a gigantic Dell mobile workstation that weighs about 5kg, isn’t portable, and is loaded with monitoring software. This actually does impede me as I often need to travel about doing presentations and such, something I’d happily do on a much lighter weight personal device as it wouldn’t require any of the tightly locked down monitoring software.

In the end, I said I would just take back my MacBook, she rarely (if ever) uses it enough to warrant its superior power versus her old one, and I don’t believe she’s even got the majority (if any) of her documents or passwords transferred to it. Is this an a**hole move?

Edit: there was also a big thing about ownership, she was very annoyed at the fact I wouldn’t just *give* it to her, and that instead she could use it for as long as she wanted, even until it died, but if she wanted to get rid of it she *had* to give it back, no disposal and no selling"
503,1jrz2yk,Not the A-hole,AITAH for inviting a mutual friend to bowl?,"For context, I (19F) was part of a setup by my friend (Girl A, also 19F), who’s talking to a new guy. She paired herself with Guy A, our friend Girl B (20F) with Guy B, and I was matched with Guy C—one of Guy A’s friends. They planned a group FaceTime to test the vibe before we all met in person. When we got on the call, everyone was laughing and joking—except Guy C. He was in the same room but didn’t say a word to me, not even my name. During the call, when I laughed at something funny, both Guy A and B said I sounded like a man. Every time I laughed, they repeated it. Afterward, Girl A asked how I felt, and I told her it was a 0/10—I felt like a third wheel.A few days later, Girl A suggested we all go bowling. I didn’t want to go, but my therapist recommended I ask Girl A if it was okay to bring a mutual friend (someone Girl A hasn’t met, but the rest of us know well). I hadn’t seen her in a while and didn’t want to feel awkward and alone again while my friends talked to their guys. Girl A was cool with it… until today.
Girl A and Girl D (another friend who randomly decided to come bowling) FaceTimed me asking why I invited the mutual. I explained it wasn’t fair to force something with Guy C if there’s no interest and that I just wanted to hang out with someone I’m comfortable with. Girl D agreed the mutual friend was cool and that Girl A would probably like her.
But then Girl A said she felt hurt. She thought the hangout would just be “us.” I apologized but reminded her that she invited random guys to this hangout, so I didn’t understand why it was suddenly a problem when I invited someone. She claimed it wasn’t a date setup and just casual, and added that if the guys flaked, we could all still hang out since “we don’t see each other often” (even though we hung out twice earlier this week).
Then they shifted the convo to my mental health. I’ve been depressed from a breakup and they said my energy has felt dark—like they miss the “old me.” They brought up my clothes, music, and general vibe, saying it makes them sad (Girl A mentioned that my sad vibe makes her want to cry). They kept suggesting ways to cope, despite me already being in therapy. I’ve been trying to stay social and upbeat around them, but I don’t like to talk about the breakup with everyone.
My mom thinks they’re fake friends for talking behind my back. I don’t know what to think anymore. Am I the asshole for inviting my friend to a “casual” hangout just because I didn’t want to feel like a third wheel again?

504,1jryyim,Everyone Sucks,AITA: For lying to my dad and sneaking out to have fun because he thinks I can't be trusted in public?,"So to clarify, It was 2021 and I lit a piece of balled up paper on fire with a cigarette lighter and was watching it burn. I heard voices and panicked and tossed them in the dumpster. You can guess what happened. Anyway I got caught and charged with arson but it was reduced to vandalism and got released from jail after 28 days and I never want to go back there. My dad however, due to the incident decided I couldn't be trusted outside the house so I was forbidden from exiting the house unless he was with me. A few months after I got released I got a job and started earning money. A few months later, I started asking my dad if I hang out with friends or go to a movie at times and he said no because I proved I was a public menace. So apparently for one incident I was deemed untrustworthy by him. I couldn't take it anymore and started going out to have fun without letting him know. I'd lie and say I was picking up extra shifts for work or that I had to stay late or just outright sneak out when he was working. I went to movies and restraunts and bowling with friends and the book store and even an escape room. That went on for over a year before one of my dad's friends saw me and told him. He was pretty angry and said this is why I couldn't be trusted. I told him that he basically said I was a bad person and public menace because of one accidental incident and he says I'm an asshole and the next time I leave to have fun then don't bother coming back. AITA?"
505,1jryxy5,Asshole,AITA for not listening to the dress code.," I have a really bad problem listening to dress codes because I get in trouble just for a bra strap and it makes me so mad, or my shoulders. I have gotten detentions, ISS and so many screaming match's with office staff. And the only reason why I haven't stopped? Petty. My school has very obvious favoritism, girls here wear worse then what I wear, I get in so much trouble for stuff everyone does INFRONT OF THEM. I had my phone out in the hall got it taken away, when literally a girl next to me didn't and she was doing the same thing. A girl next to me can be wearing WORSE  than me and I get in trouble. It's very obvious, but going om with the story. So I was in my class after lunch and I was talking to a friend until I got sent down to the office, well I go down and they gave me a shirt. The most ugliest shirt I have seen in my whole life. It was so UGLY. I went back to my class and started talking to my friend about it, it was a study hall and we're normally allowed to talk but I was mad so I kept talking about it until my teacher told me to wear it or go home. I went to the bathroom, HATED IT so I wrapped it around my neck so it'd cover everything, my teacher got mad sent me back to put it on correctly, I went back into the bathroom and called one of my homeschooled friends, I put it under the shirt I was wearing and it just made me feel stupid, but I still had it on. I wore it refusing to talk to my teacher until my next class started and I was with my friends in class and I showed them how stupid the shirt was and they laughed so as I but I had a sharpie so I decided to take the sharpy and write ""F dress code."" My friends laughed and I slipped it back on nothing else happens till I get called to the office again to the principal, SHE WAS PISSED. She asked what I wrote on my shirt and I just straight up told her I wrote ""F the Dress code"" I said very calmly because I didn't really care. She started saying how irresponsible, rude, careless I was and I just stood there blank starring at her just saying okay to everything she was saying. She started basically yelling do you understand me and I was like yep. Then she kept yelling more and gave me two days of ISS. I really didn't care I just left and complained how I have ISS to my bf nothing much. But the thing that got me thinking I am the asshole, well like two things. One people are calling me a wh0re for the stuff I wear and two my mom and grandma were livid they kept saying stuff while not even listening to me, they have always taken the one with most authority side and never me. Me and my family haven't even talked much since. So AITA"
506,1jryngy,Not the A-hole,AITA for ditching my arrogant teacher’s band rehearsal?,"
I am a flute player who has been dedicating myself to band for two years. We had these band rehearsals for an upcoming concert, but every time this happened, he would always be yelling at us. He would constantly remind us of how we are wasting his “precious” time, and if we weren’t gonna be dedicated to his class, then we should apply for something else.
However, I missed two of these band rehearsals, and for that, he dropped my grade to a B. Now, some may say that isn’t so bad, but would it be bad if it was something that took place after school?

Recently, I sent him an email asking him if there was anything I could do to put my grade back up (mainly because my parents are strict on me). Instead of responding, he just talks to me during his class saying he would change it back. But here’s the interesting part, a few days later he changed his mind! I’m not obligated to say he must change my grade. However, he kept changing his mind, almost as if my grade depended on his mood! 

Another thing I would like inform you guys about is that he also forced me into his zero period guitar class. Last school year, I asked him a question about guitar class saying that it sounded interesting. He took this as a sign to enroll me into the class without asking for my choice. The thing with zero period guitar class is that it’s early in the morning.Because of this, I arriving late and ultimately decided to quit because I didn’t want to interrupt class, disrespect the teacher, and for some personal reasons.

He kept removing me from extra activities, but what really takes the cake is when he held me back from his class to talk to me about how well the guitar class was doing saying that an “exceptional student” was missing out. I felt like he wasn’t respecting MY choice of leaving, and I even considered leaving the band class. In order to leave the class, I would have to TALK to him about quitting. 

Eventually, I got fed up, and decided to ditch an upcoming band rehearsal for a concert and went to go treat myself to a snack. Apparently, I had made the right decision since I heard he was doing nothing but yelling at the people attending the rehearsal. It was as if the old man was having a tantrum like a toddler. 

Later on next week, I told him I couldn’t go to the next rehearsal because of a dentist appointment. Before I move on, I would like to clarify on how annoying it is to re-book dental appointments, especially since this one was booked two months prior, and that the dental office was 30 minutes away. I didn’t expect him to be understanding, I was just trying to inform him. However, after I told him, he started lecturing me. He started rudely saying how I should leave band, and how DISRESPECTFUL my family. My band teacher DOES NOT have the right to call MY family disrespectful for booking an appointment on the same day as his rehearsal.  

First of all, unlike my appointment, his rehearsals were announced one time via email A DAY BEFORE THE REHEARSAL. "
507,1jrybmc,Everyone Sucks,AITA for not giving my friend a lift?,"I (29F) been good friends with this guy (29M) for 5 years now.

Last night we went out for dinner. It was close to my house (a 10 minute drive away) but he was coming straight from work in the city, so the journey was around 45 mins for him. He commutes to work on a combination of public transport and motorbike. He leaves his motorbike at the station and then takes the train to the city.

Within 5 minutes of meeting him, he ""jokingly"" says 'thanks for offering to give me a lift back'. I ""jokingly"" tell him that I hadn't decided if I would.

After the food was ordered, he said that he had a huge lunch and wasn't really hungry. If I had known I would have ordered less. He tells me I'm lucky that he's going to be paying for half because he didn't eat much (basically saying I should be forking the bill).

He brings up me giving him a lift back again. He says that he'll make a mental note if I don't drop him back. I'm super annoyed at this point and I tell him that I'll give him a lift back if he gets the bill for dinner. He calls me a cheapskate. The bill comes and we ended up splitting. I look up directions to both his house and the station. His area does have pretty terrible public transport. I explain to him that I can drop him off but that I was asking him to pay the bill for me as a favour, the same way he's asking for a lift as a favour. I'm not poor but just extremely cash flow restricted right now. He knows my situation but I think he struggles to understand it because I don't look like I'm struggling. I paid for dinner using my mum's credit card that she gave me for emergencies because mine declined. He sends a transfer for £25.

When we get in the car, I let him know that I can drop him off at his house, which is 30 mins away. He wants to be dropped at the station where he left his motorbike, which is 45 mins away. I tell him that he can collect it in the morning (which is a Saturday). I know I should have suggested that at the restaurant itself. It only clicked in the car that there is usually traffic around that particular station on a Friday evening. Plus I realized, once inside the car, that there was only a quarter tank of gas. We have an argument. He tells me that he would never ask his other friends to pay for him. I respond by saying that I wouldn't inconvenience friends by requesting lifts.

He tells me that I don't have to give him a lift if I don't want to. I tell him that I honestly don't want to. He gets out of the car and calls an Uber. I transferred him the £25 back today morning.

This is never an issue with my other friends. We take turns travelling to each other (not that we keep count). And no one else asks me for lifts. I will usually offer lifts to the nearest convenient station though (I live in London and there are around 4 to choose from).

P.S. I should mention that he gave me a lift a few weeks ago. "
508,1jry9p7,Not the A-hole,AITA for possibly canceling the trip I planned for my neices birthday?,"I 37 F have always gone out of my way for my neices and nephews because their parents aren't great. Co F 15, Em F 13 and To M 11. I have let them come over and stay the night when they needed breaks from the loudness of their house. I have always made sure they had anything they wanted while here

Recently we've all fallen on hard times and are living under the same roof. I have been helping them and being there for them. I am the person they come to when they need help. I have helped with homework at times. They come to me when they need someone to to talk to or when they're bored. I usually drop everything and play with them and listen when they need a shoulder. 

The oldest Co and I are the closest. I have gone above and beyond to be there for her and help support her in any way that I can. She can be insecure I have bought her clothing items that she loves in the size she prefers. Which her parents don't even do. I make sure she can come to me any time she wants. I bought games that I know she likes and spent hours playing them with her. 

We have had these same sort of arguments before of me feeling taken advantage of, but nothing ever changes. 

Yesterday I made a special effort with my bf to take Co to get her hair cut, because she knew her parents wouldn't, and then after I took her to dinner as a surprise. We also got her some snacks. My SIL didn't even say thank you for me doing that for her daughter or even comment on the cut.

I'm disabled  so it's hard for me to cleanup much. So every few months I ask the kids to help me clean and I always reward them for it. 

A week or so ago I talked to my SIL about it and we discussed it and she said it was fine. Yesterday I asked the kids to help me today and that I had rewards for them. 

Today I guess they didn't want to help and my SIL threw a fit that I didn't ask her first...even though I did and that they never want to help her clean but they'll help me. 

So when I argued that I did tell her she was like I won't make them help. I at no point in time asked her to make them. That didn't even come up at all except from her. I would have talked to the kids myself. But she was such a B word that I didn't even bother. 

She is a ""stay at home mom"" since she's too psycho to actually hold a job. She's not physically disabled at all but I am. She barely does anything around the house but I'm lazy according to her. 

Co was in the room with her mom putting me down and saying I'm always asking them to help. Which again it's been months since the last time I asked them to help. 

Honestly though I feel like helping me once in a while is the least they can do considering all I do for them. I am genuinely just hurt. I go out of my way for all of them and rarely get anything back. 

I promised Co that I would take her somewhere special for her birthday next month. AITA If I cancel because of her behavior?"
509,1jrxypd,Everyone Sucks,AITA for calling my dad an idiot,"I sat down on the couch with my dad m/50 and asked him who would be coming to our family lunch tomorrow. When I asked he said a couple of our family members. Now my family is extremely religious, and hate tattoos and dyed hair and the whole thing. Now i have black hair and mini bangs because i just like it. I asked my dad 
“Can I not go, I know they are going to say something” 
My dad responded with 
“So you just want adults to shut the fuck up” 
This took me by surprise and I responded with a simple “yep” obviously being sarcastic he then decided to say 
“You know there used to be this saying that kids shouldn’t be seen or heard” 
This boiled my blood because just because you’re a minor doesn’t mean you don’t know anything or have opinions. So I responded 
“I think you’re idiot.” 
Now out of all the things I could have called him that was extremely tame especially because of what he just said to me. Then my mum decided to jump in saying 
“Hey, don’t speak like that to your dad.” 
 And all I could think of was so he can say that to me but I can’t call him an idiot because that shatters his fragile ego. So I walked off and said 
“I think you’re both idiots for even thinking that”
Now my both of my parents think I’m a complete asshole."
510,1jrx4pj,Not the A-hole,AITA for not giving my friend one of the freebies from my skincare order ?,"So I ordered a bunch of stuff during a skincare sale and they were doing this promo where if you spent over a certain amount, they gave you three “mystery gifts.” I didn’t know what they were gonna be but I was excited because I’ve been broke and haven’t treated myself in a while.

When the box came, I opened it with my friend there and the gifts were actually kind of nice? A lip mask, a jade roller, and this little overnight cream I’ve been wanting to try. I was like omg cute and set them aside with the rest of my stuff.

Then my friend just casually picks up the lip mask and goes, “oh this is so nice, thanks for saving this for me.” I laughed cause I thought she was joking but she was literally putting it in her purse. I said wait no, I didn’t say you could have that, and she goes, “okay chill, it’s just a freebie.”

I told her yeah it was free, but it still came with my order, and I was kind of looking forward to using it. She got all weird and said I was being stingy and that “if you didn’t pay for it, it’s not even a real gift.”

I didn’t even know how to respond to that. I’m not mad, I just feel kind of awkward now and like maybe I overreacted about something small? But also… it was mine?

511,1jrwzmf,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not letting my roommates boyfriend use my car, even though it made him miss a job interview?","So I (25F) share an apartment with my roommate Jess (24F). We generally get along okay, but she started dating this guy Kyle a few months ago and he's been around constantly. He doesn’t live here officially, but he's here 5–6 nights a week, eats our food, uses our stuff, and never really contributes to anything. It’s annoying but I’ve tolerated it to keep the peace.

I own a car, which I use for work, errands, and occasional weekend trips. Jess doesn’t have a car, and neither does Kyle.

Last week, Kyle asked me very last minute if he could borrow my car to drive to a job interview. I asked a few questions — where it was, how far, how long he’d need it — and it turned out he needed it during a time I’d already told Jess I had a doctor’s appointment across town. I said sorry, but I needed it and couldn't change my appointment.

He got pissed and said I was being selfish and ruining his shot at a “better life.” Jess backed him up, saying I could Uber to the doctor “just this once,” because his interview was more important than my check-up.

I said no. I’m not comfortable lending my car to someone I barely know, especially not for a time I already need it. I don’t owe him that. They both sulked and gave me the cold shoulder for days. Kyle apparently missed the interview because “he couldn’t find a ride” and is now blaming me for “ruining his future.”

I feel a little bad, because I could have changed my appointment if I really wanted to… but also, it’s my car, my schedule, and I don’t think I should have to upend my plans for someone who doesn’t even live here.

AITA?

512,1jrwoqr,Asshole,AITA for accepting a ride from a coworker?,"Okay so sorry if this is a long post and sorry im on mobile so formattings probably bad, but basically I work at a restaurant and we get out late at night past when the busses go and my vehicle broke down and I couldn't afford an Uber so me(28f) and my ex(38m) started on our 30 minute walk home, for the most part we tolerate eachother with minimal issues. Well we (or I thought we) were talking about something as I kept getting acknowledgements from him so then I asked a question which he got snippy and rudely goes ""what?!?!"" And I just rolled my eyes and moved to the otherside of the street and he decided to walk ahead and I'm behind him about 4 feet at this point (we don't live in the best neighbourhood) there's usually not much traffic at night and usually on the street I was on its usually a cop so while I try to stay aware I don't turn my head at every vehicle I hear coming up, well I hear a vehicle slow down and stop right beside me so I do what any woman would do I just keep walking and then I hear a voice my female coworker (I'll call her t), she's sitting in the passenger seat and I realise it's another old coworker who used to work with us (he lives on that street We'll call him c) so I automatically feel safe seeing as I know these people and I see t on an almost daily basis and c I see usually once a week or every other week, so they know im pregnant I have my purse on me and they told me I was getting in the car and they weren't going to take no for an answer, well as soon as I get in the car and told them where to head to I feel my phone buzz and my eyes roll to the back of my head and I told them oh he's messaging me something along the lines of ""oh when where the fk?"" Then another text ""yup I see you called your boyfriend to come get you""( I dont have a bf and most definitely don't want one) to which I replied im in the car with t and c they wouldn't take no as an answer and c asks me to video call him and she'd answer (he doesn't like her, she's nice but very only child type if that makes sense attitude wise lol) as im getting ready to call c is already calling him from the car and you can hear ex is pissed and he hung up on c, well I get home I tell them thank you again and  I'm waiting about 20m cuz I didn't have my keys (whoops) then ex shows up pissed and supposedly c drove back by him on the way back and offered him a ride at which point he yelled at c and continued to walk so aita for getting a ride and not having them pick him up? "
513,1jrwlwx,Not the A-hole,AITA for avoiding confrontation?,"I’ve been friends with this particular person for a while now. We weren’t friends at first because I was always under the impression that they only ever spoke to me if they needed something which, granted, wasn’t untrue. I helped this person from our early teens to well beyond that into our early careers. In fact, I was a major part of their acceptance into a prestigious field that we were both vying for: I wrote the pieces that got them in. I was severely depressed and during the time I was meant to be working to get in too, but I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. My parent had just been diagnosed with cancer and not long after became permanently disabled. I am now a full-time caregiver while said friend is finding success in their field. I’m happy for them but have never been able to reconcile the fact that I built them up for success only to end up no where. I know I have no one to blame but myself.

we’re meant to have a one on one conversation between us to talk about us. 

I don’t want to have this talk. 

I do not have the time, energy, or mental capacity to have a discussion about how bad of a friend I am, how badly I’ve hurt their feelings, and how this all makes them feel about our friendship. I don’t care. I know how difficult it can be to be my friend. But at this point, there is nothing about them or their life that I relate to or care enough to relate to when all they speak about is material things and going out when the times that I have tried to reach out for support during this period of my life where I no longer have the freedom to live for myself because of how tied I am to the wellbeing/survival of my family have been ignored. Forgive me for thinking that one failed project or attempt is not that big of a deal when I’m dealing with the fact that I am covered in feces and balancing the future of my career and the livelihood of my immediate family who depends one me. I would rather they ghost me than go through all the drama of setting a date when I barely have time to piss alone. This could very well be a phone call.

I will admit that I can be the bad guy in their story; I’m not so far removed from myself to think that I’m a saint. They’ve done their fair share of putting up with my BS about relationships and limerence, so it would be unfair to say that I’m innocent. However, I have shared the entirely of my young adult life with them only for me to end up no where with no help from them. There are plenty of things they’ve done that I have not agreed with and have been right about in the end. I’ve stopped contributing my opinion when they do update me about their life. This person is often inconsiderate of how some “jokes” they make about loved ones’ health and my own mental health aren’t very funny. I no longer share my life with them because I do not feel safe or trust them enough. 

So. 

AITA for not caring about maintaining this friendship? Am I thinking too much about what this one on one conversation could be about?"
514,1jrvl78,Not the A-hole,"WIBTA if I confront my roommate about stomping and slamming doors, instead of just confronting/communicating with me??","OK… so, for context: I live in a sober living program. My fiancé and I (32F) share a bedroom, and my roommate (24F) shares the other room with her boyfriend. The rooms are right next to each other, separated by a thin wall—so we hear pretty much everything.

Not trying to be rude, but my roommates basically just sleep all the time. That’s not an exaggeration—it’s just how they are. Since it’s the weekend, I like to chill at night and watch Netflix, especially because our weekdays are packed with IOP, therapy, meetings, all that. My roommates, on the other hand, go to bed early—even on weekends. Cool, do your thing.

The issue is she expects us to be completely silent—whispering, tiptoeing, no matter what hour it is. I get not wanting to be woken up, but when you live in a small space with thin walls and old doors, some noise is just part of life. Our bedroom door, for example, makes a loud popping noise every time it opens or shuts. We can’t control that.

About an hour ago, I got up to pee. The door popped when I opened it (as it always does). I was already cringing because I knew it would disturb them, but I even left it open so it would only pop once more instead of twice. Trying to be thoughtful. When I came back and shut it, it popped again. A few seconds later, my roommate swings her door open super hard—like I thought the knob was gonna go right through the wall. She stomps to the bathroom, huffing and puffing, slams the toilet lid, and then slams the door so hard something actually fell off the wall.

I was stunned. Just sat there like… really? Who acts like that?

And the thing is—this isn’t even the first time. The first time it happened, I asked her about it. She acted like she was mad at her boyfriend, not me. But I know better. They argue a lot, sure, but this was different. The passive-aggressive vibe was obvious.

Honestly, if she had just knocked and said, “Hey, everything echoes. Can you try to keep it down?” I would’ve apologized and made more of an effort. But slamming stuff and possibly breaking things? That’s not okay. People have literally been discharged from our program for that kind of shit!

So now I’m wondering—should I talk to her? Not in a confrontational way. Just something like, “Hey, if something’s bothering you, just talk to me. No need to slam doors and stomp around.” Because I really don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect basic communication and respect when we’re all living so close together.

That said, I can’t help but wonder… would confronting her like that make me the asshole?"
515,1jrv1j2,No A-holes here,AITA I told my sister I don't think her behavior is normal and I'm tired of it,"So I (24F) recently bought a house that my sister (26F) and my brother (out of state rn) will be living in, as my dad had his immigrant family move into the one we were renting from him. Tensions have been high as we don't know them and dont speak the language (my dad lives in another state so we're their only support) but on top of that we obviously just moved and have new house bs to deal with.

We're doing our best to get settled. My dad gave us some money to spend so we've been mostly looking on fb marketplace.

For the few weeks we've been looking, it's evident we dont have 1-to-1 tastes. That's okay with me, Im usually chill about getting ""aesthetically pleasing"" stuff whenever we've needed in the past.

But this is my house, and there are some things I want. I know she'll be upset if i buy smth that doesnt match her theme, so ive been clearing things with her beforehand... or trying to.

If i show her 20 things she'll hate 15 and only sort of tolerate the rest. FB marketplace is a numbers game,  you cant be THAT picky when you have a small budget.

My sister won't budge. Shes doing her best to take my feedback about what I want when she shows me her listings, but she's SO SERIOUS about these things she sounds aggrieved I even bothered to show her smth that she dislikes. 

It came to a head last night when we were talking about it again. I made an offhand comment about the search we've been doing and her pickiness. Not directly but implying it. Realizing my mistake,  I tried to backtrack but she kept pressing.

She said it's clear we CAN come to agreements, we're even grabbing a tableset on saturday, and I agreed. Then she was like ""it's just, you dont have an eye for things... like theres science behind color theory and your interior design choices affecting your mental wellbeing."" I balked at this, telling her that just because im not as picky as her doesnt mean im not designing the house with a good theme in mind. Like im not going to furnish the house in such an egregious way that it'll cause her mental distress. 

This is where I think I fucked up. Because when she responded to that statement I said smth along the lines of ""Yeah and I've been dealing with your demands but it's only cuz youre my sister, like imagine you were living with your friends, this would not happen."" 

She snapped. She told me she was tired of me ""saying shit like that"" all the time (I did call her a ""tiktok girlie"" the other day when we argued and that REALLY pissed her off). I got frustrated and said ""I'm saying shit like this all the time bc I'm the only one who has to put up with it! Like you're under the impression that all of this is normal, but I really dont think it is""

She stormed off after that, but we share a mattress on the ground rn so I just let her go to sleep first. She hasnt spoken to me since last night. I know she's waiting for me to apologize, but I really dont want to. AITA here?

Edits because apparently this needs clearing up:

1. This is my house. I bought it. It's in my name. My dad did not contribute to this house, neither did my siblings.

HOWEVER:

2. They will be paying rent. Sister pays about 22%, brother about 29%. I cover the rest of mortgage. They are not paying anymore than they did when they were living in my dads house (actually my brother pays less because I assumed he paid less than he actually did to my father, and it turns out thats roughly even payment wise so i didnt care) I am simply paying more. They pay less than a third each, while I pay almost half. Seems fair enough to them.

3. My dad gave ME 4k to spend on the house. This is the supposed ""budget"" some people are touting. It's not my *entire* budget, but I am trying to stretch it to its max, because I can only pay so much more furniture wise out of pocket. And we have NOTHING.

4. We sleep on a folding mattress as a TEMPORARY MEASURE. Because my dads family took our mattresses, and I LET THEM have the one I bought only a couple years back (it was a shitty amazon one that actually wasnt too bad but needless to say I want to buy *good* mattresses this time around which is not cheap and also full of fraud!)

I love my sister very much but yes, she has been working my last nerve when I wrote this."
516,1jrtosb,Asshole,AITA For Not Spending my birthday with my wife?,"So on my birthday, I spent most of the day either with my kids or my friends. 

Kids were home today so from like when they woke up to when school would usually end they were with me. My wife had some stuff to do at the office and was gone from 9-5 but I saw her in the morning. 

When my wife came back from work, I told her I was gonna head out with to meet up with friends which she already knew, but I guess she thought I’d be gone for less time than I actually was. I left around 5:45 and came back closer to 11-11:15. When I come back my wife is still awake in the living room and is pretty upset I didn’t make any time for her during the day. She said she wanted to get up to some stuff with me (whatever that means) and I ruined it for her. She just gave me my gift then went to sleep.

I feel I’m not wrong, because it is my birthday, and I thought everyone was happy:  I spent most of the day with my kids and I got to hang out with my friends. She feels differently though. 

AITA?"
517,1jrt27j,Not the A-hole,AITAfor running away for a night?,"OK, so basically I 15 M ran away for a night from my mom 56F because we had a fight so basically we moved last weekend and I was having a lot of stress because of school. I’m getting bullied at school because I’m gay and because I’m on the chubby side, so she kept asking me to do things when I got home when I was sore stressed cause all that my schoolwork is piling up because I keep trying to rest and I never can cause I’m always asked to do something. I haven’t had a break in three weeks on the weekends I’ve been packing. I can barely log onto one of my video games which I know that’s not crazy, but it is to me I used to play every day. It’s one of my favorite games, but I ran away and went to my friends house after me and her had a fight about me setting up my bed because it’s not set up yet and she lost the bolts for it. She lost the bolts and earlier that day we almost lost the cat since she left the door open for an hour when we left, and I was so stressed from that I cried we found them they were in the house. They never left them. The door was open, but with all that stress after we were done fighting for a minute, I went to my room for a minute then I went downstairs and left the door while I was going downstairs she asked me to take the cat litter out, and I did. I threw it in a trashcan and then I walked to a friend house. This is one of my best friends they are 17 F they’re really nice to me. I walked over to their house. It’s not that far so very easy. I went there without any electronics on me. All I had was the clothes on my back while there I waited 30 minutes then I texted my mom saying I’m safe. I’m staying at a friend house for the night then I just turned off notifications on their phone for that person and waited till the next day for this. I did have school so I texted her at 3 AM saying i’m going to school. I will see you after because I just borrowed my friends computer. I know my login and they have an extra one went to school for the day was stressed about it then I went home to my mom and dad on the couch. They’ve been divorced for years so I’m surprised that they even talk to each other. I have to get something with both of their permission on it just so I can go to the other one’s house for a day so this was surprising at least so I just continued on I talk to them. It was a really sad talk. I was in trouble grounded for three months cause I had them so stressed. I did run away so my mom would realize why I’ve been so stressed and why I just need a break. I didn’t have 10 minutes to sit down. She yelled at me while I was in the bathroom saying to get up so yeah I just needed a break and that helped so much just a day awayso am I the asshole for running away for a day?"
518,1jrqq2t,Asshole,AITA for not waiting for my friend to go on a trip we planned together?,"So basically, Me (OP, 25) and someone we'll call M, 24 planned a trip to go to the Keys. We were going to leave Saturday after our volleyball tournament which started at 8am and I was hoping to leave the tournament no later than noon. I unfortunately became injured and could no longer attend the tournament on Saturday. After I talked to M, he told me that the tournament was most likely going well past noon and most likely finishing around 2-3pm. I told M, I'm going to go watch the tournament until noon and if the tournament isn't over by noon, then I'm leaving on my own to the Keys and you can catch a ride with our mutual friend who is also on the volleyball team that is also going to the Keys. Today which is Friday, I woke up to messages from M stating, ""bro if you can't wait for me I'm not going"". So... am I the asshole if I don't wait for M to finish the tournament and head to the Keys without him earlier in the day?

  
Additional Context: We already live in Miami and the Keys is about an hour drive from where we are, I just wanted to throw this in the post in case people were thinking that the trip was going to a long trip or plane ride away."
519,1jrpckg,Not the A-hole,AITA for wanting my baby pictures that my sister found?,"My sister won’t give me my baby pictures. Am I the asshole for thinking she should?

A little background: I got married as soon as I turned 18 and left home with just the clothes on my back. I grew up in a very toxic household with a lot of trauma, so getting out was a form of survival for me. I didn’t take anything with me—not that I would’ve been allowed to, even if I’d tried.

My parents had a nasty relationship and an even uglier divorce. They ended up losing both homes, and everything that once belonged to us as a family got dumped in storage at my uncle’s place. He had a spare room at the farm and let it all sit there.

Fast forward several years—I’m at a scrapbooking retreat, and my younger sister casually mentions she has my baby pictures. I was surprised, and when I asked her how she got them, she said she went through the storage at our uncle’s and pulled them from an album she found.

Naturally, I asked if I could have my baby pictures. Her response? A flat-out no. She said she found them, so they’re hers to keep. These aren’t just any pictures—they’re black-and-white, thick-paper, vintage photos from the motherland. One-of-a-kind. There are no copies or backups.

I’ve asked her more than once over the years to reconsider, and she refuses. Her reasoning is: “If it wasn’t for me, you wouldn’t have them at all, so what’s the difference?” She even told me that she plans to leave them to her children—not mine—and that I’ll never have them.

It feels deeply unfair and honestly cruel, but maybe I’m too emotionally close to it. Am I the asshole for thinking she should give me the baby pictures of me, or is she justified in keeping them because she found them?"

We are both studying a different type of engineering discipline and at our school every engineering major is required to take a design class where we group up and build/design a unique project/device. The issue I have is that everyone else in our group (2 other people) and myself are basically doing the entire project and my roommate keeps making excuses for not showing up/preparing properly for our meetings (this is communicated clearly in a iMessage group chat, days in advance). I was feeling very frustrated because our deadline is coming up and I have big projects in other classes, while comparatively she does not have as much work. I know this because she is taking either the same classes as me, or classes I have already taken. Obviously she's busy and is allowed to have her own life. Her reasons are sometimes valid but sometimes she says something and I come back to the dorm and find her doing something else. I was ranting about the situation to my mom and she said I shouldn't enable the behavior by just smiling and nodding and that I should say something (gently of course). I love my mother but she was telling me to be harsh and mean which is definitely not what I want to do. My question is, what should I say and how should I say it? and WIBTA if I confronted her about this?"
521,1jroz3w,Not the A-hole,AITA for blaming my 'promiscuity' on my mother?,"My mom has always criticized my outfits, how much makeup I wear and how many boyfriends I've had. Generally, I ignore her because it's what I'm used to hearing. But last weekend when she visited me in college, she really pissed me off. She kept going on about what I was wearing, who I was seeing etc. She said I'm not the child she raised and that she was confused how I didn't turn out to be a good woman of faith like her. I just lost it. 

I called her a hypocrite and told her that she was the reason I was like this. She can act as pioused as she wants, but it didn't change the fact that she was not an example of a stable woman growing up. I told her everything she hates about me now is a direct reflection if her parenting. 

And none of it is even a lie. She wasn't always a religious person. It has only been like this the past 6 or 7 years. Before then, she would bring home different men every other month. She didn't always wear these 80s style dresses. 

She just broke down and called me ungrateful. She left after that but now my sister is calling me a horrible b**** for treating my mom like that. I'll be honest, I don't have any regrets but I need some level headed people to help me see clearly. I'm sorry for upsetting her so much but I have been dealing with her self righteousness for the last few years and I am sick of it.

523,1jrmbca,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my friend we're bored of him yapping about a single anime every day?,"So, we're three friends. Two men, one woman. We have been through hell and back together. For the sake of the story, one of our friends is called ""Daniel"", last year we introduced him into the world of anime. We would show the famous and classics to match his taste. Both my friend, we'll call her ""Laura"", and  I would introduce him so we could chat about it. We never forced it or we  gave him space whenever he asked us to stop talking about it. Now, Daniel has been enamored with one. Well, more of an obsession. He has talked about it for more than 7 months at this point, every day, every encounter would be about it. Laura and I are sick of it. We just called him out about it (We were blunt and straight about it, not being able to handle it longer). He tries to hide about being upset, but there's resentment and even hurt in there. Are we the A-hole? Did we approach it too insensitively?

\+ Add on- no matter how much we tried to change the subject normally he always changed it back to what he was talking about or- he straight up interrupt the conversation and brings the theme up while we didnt mention anything about it. Which most of the times, was nothing related to the anime. 

And add to that he can spend a whole day talking about this topic and he has done that with us- like 4 hours (via messages or direct chatting) with no way of escaping that topic. We both feel like we're drowning. "
524,1jrm6fu,Not the A-hole,AITA for wanting my flatmates to be quiet,"Okay so I’m gonna try and make this short but I (18F) started my first year of uni in September 2024. When joining I decided to live on campus for the first year and got a pretty good room onsite. Only downside is that it is positioned right next to the common room/kitchen area in a way so if I turn to the left the common room is basically there. I think I should also add that I’m in the top floor (so floor 2/2). Quickly realised how much of a mistake living on campus was. Almost every single day and night, the people downstairs occupy the kitchen. They’re a large obnoxious group of people who were friends before starting uni and give off really cliquey/high school vibes. These people are loud. Very f**king loud. All day. All night. I hate it. 

The weather has been very warm lately where I live so I’ve had to leave my window open meaning I can hear all of their noise from downstairs. Normally this noise goes from 8pm-3am ANY day of the week (I have so many 9am classes btw). Today it’s made me lose my mind a bit. They are BLASTING music and shouting and yelling. It’s only 9:30pm currently on a Friday which I know I should expect noise but this noise is just excessive. It woke me up after I accidentally fell asleep a few hours ago and now I won’t be able to sleep again. I ranted to two of my friends about it and both of the said something along the lines of “let them have fun”. This kind of annoyed me. If them having fun is costing me my sleep and sanity then screw them. 

But hey I might be being a selfish asshole for wanting a bit of quietness and wanting to sleep. (Also one of them has now started violently vomiting outside of my room which does not sound pleasant). 

Anyways AITA?

(Edit) A few things I want to add is that 1: I’m slightly autistic (diagnosed) and I don’t really cope well with all of the noise in general. 2: These people have been threatened with bans by multiple pubs and clubs and the student union events because of how loud and obnoxious they are. 3: I once called security 3 nights in a row on them because they were making SO much noise around 1am-4am during the week and they still haven’t learnt to keep the noise down.

525,1jrldit,Not the A-hole,AITAH For not responding to my spouses 'I'm hungy' comment?,She(34F) has had an upset stomach for a couple days and is struggling with that. She expected me(36M) to respond to her by asking her what she wants to do for dinner. I thought she was just making another complaint about her stomach. I argued that she should have brought up dinner if dinner is what she wanted to talk about. She says I should have been the one to bring it up because the statement 'I'm hungry' is a plea for help and designed to make someone notice what their needs are.
526,1jrlba8,Not the A-hole,AITA for being in an influencer's gym video?,"Throwaway and fake names for obvious reasons.

I (29m) belong to a gym that has very lax filming rules. As long as people are respectful of others, anyone can film. There's one influencer Clare (mid 20s f) who works out there and is incredibly nice. She's always asking if people are okay with her filming angles, if they're okay with being in the background, or if they would prefer her to wait to film until they are done. She makes a point to say hello and make people feel welcome. When my fiance Jen (28) started coming with me, she went out of her way to introduce herself and offer to workout with Jen if she wanted a female lifting buddy. Clare is well liked, and my fiance became a fan of hers as a result. 

Recently, I have been going to the gym without Jen since she doesn't feel as motivated to come. A couple weeks ago, Clare asked if I could spot her for a chest press PR. It was being filmed and she disclosed it would be on her channel. I was okay with this and spotted her. The video was posted yesterday and Jen saw that I gave Clare a side hug after her set. She was upset that I was in the video and thought that it looked like I was too close to Clare. She has argued that it would give viewers the impression that I might be with or into Clare. I watched the video and did not get at impression at all. To me, it simply looks like a mini celebration after a particularly hard lift. Jen wants me to ask Clare to remove the video, but I don't want to. It's harmless. Jen is now mad at me and is giving me the silent treatment. Am I the asshole for allowing myself to be in the video?"
527,1jrk0mp,Not the A-hole,AITA? Help! Am I the asshole?!?!,"My fiancé and I have been together for 2 years. We have a 8 month old son together (both first time parents). I have our son full time while he goes to work. My fiancé just started a new job 3 days ago (super easy going job). Last night after I had picked him up from work he completely ignored our son. He said he needed to relax and sat down on the couch scrolling on TikTok for hours saying that he is to tired to spend time with our son and I. Around midnight I asked if he could turn the living room light off so I can save money for electricity since I am the one paying the bills (i work from home) and he completely ignored me again. I get up with our son in the middle of the night, take care of him all day, and basically do everything for him. Doctor's appointments, basic needs, feedings, etc all while doing everything around the house. My fiancé has been acting like this since 2 months after our son was born. Comes home from work, says he's tired, ignores my son and i, and then goes to bed. My c-section was very hard on me as I have a few major health issues, which took me longer to heal from. I am absolutely drained mentally and physically i truly am at the end of my rope feeling like he wants nothing to do with our son. He says I'm overreacting and we got into an argument for over a half an hour. In the heat of the moment I yelled at him that if he doesn't care about our son or me then why is he even here. Am I the asshole for wanting him to spend time with our son? "
528,1jrju75,Not the A-hole,AITA what do i do now,"I will try to keep it short. 2 i moved to canada with my parents cause my parents wants me to go in a good university so we came here from asia. And there are just so many people coming to canada right now everything is really expensive and we have been having a lot of financial problems. But that doesnt stop my parents from buying my 12 year old sister anything she wants. She even got a new phone after crying for it for 1 week. I DONT HOW THEY ARE GETTING THE MONEY TO BUY HER STUFF WHEN WE ARE AT ROCK BOTTOM. Well anyways ofc since im 16 i should understand so i dont get anything and i also dont ask for anything. they have been spending a lot of money on her and just buying her new shoes etc. I was able to find an online video editing job and I started to earn some money. I was really happy about it cause I always wanted a laptop and now I can finally buy one in the next few weeks. kind of forgot but I had around 1k saved up and the laptop I wanted was 2.2k.

And one day my parents ask me if they can borrow some money. And i totally get that we are in canada on student visa and our financial situation is really bad. They said once I have earned the remaining 1.2k and ready to buy the laptop they will pay me back. And they are working really hard and sacrificed so much to move to canada so I have a better future so I give it to them. And now once there was a 30% discount on the laptop and i really wanted to get it so i ask my parents and they said they cant give it back rn. which is understandable but it just made me so mad. im still really mad rn. And im like. even after borowing the money cause they really had to pay the bills. NO MATTER HOW BAD THINGS GET THEY NEVER STOP BUYING STUFF FOR MY SISTER. like doesnt matter how she behaves or what she does. She will get what she wants and my parents especially my dad will just do it. doesnt matter how shity the situation is she wants smth and he will jus buy it. and thats why im just really mad cause I worked for that mmoney so i can get a laptop and now its not there, i missed out on a good offer and now idk when i will be able to get my laptop :(. idk im just so mad rn ik they are sturgelilng but i also know they are WASTING so much money on the stupid shit my sister makes them buy. 🙏 Like comon. rn all i have in me is hate. I just hating them now. i thought it will go away with time but each day i just get more angry. its been like 2 weeks now."
529,1jrjkho,Everyone Sucks,AITA for not being happy with my birthday gift?,"I want to start by saying that gift giving is my love language. My husband knows this and I also recognize gift giving is not his strength. I make it as easy as I can for him, but somehow he still falls below expectations.

My birthday was the 23rd and I made an Amazon wish list and shared it with him sometime in February. The list is the same one I send to my BFF so usually they have to communicate who's getting what to not duplicate. My BFF spoke with him a few weeks before my birthday so all should have been good there for him knowing what not to get me. My birthday comes along and he gets me something from the list, sure, but it's like $20 protein powder. Mind you, for his last birthday I got him an electric chainsaw and a battery totaling about $160. When I asked him if he got me anything else he told me he was broke.. I get that to a point but I thought maybe I'd be worth planning ahead a bit? He got paid the Friday after my birthday and I'd be okay with a late gift also! He makes speakers in our basement as a hobby and he came into my office today to show me a new one he made and shared that he spent $150 on building it. My best friend planned a whole girls trip for us for my birthday and spent a ton on it. Meanwhile I mentioned to my husband after my birthday it would have been nice to do something just us two, but he kind of shrugged it off. If I wanted anything to happen I know I would've needed to plan it. I just know if I bring it up to him I'm going to seem ungrateful. I appreciate the gift I did get, but I honestly think he bought the first thing he saw off the list to just check a box. 

I know I need to have a conversation with him about our expectations for gifts for each other and that will happen. I just don't want to have to lower to his standards when I love getting him grander gifts because I know that's what he'll like. I put a lot of thought into his gifts too, considering he never gives me a list. "
530,1jrj83w,Asshole,AITA for being uncomfortable by my neighbors sunglasses and causing the whole family to avoid me?,"I’m new to a neighborhood (new construction), and I’ve only met my neighbor a few times. We live in the South, which might affect some of the social dynamics here. Also, this all happened in late January, which I mention because I think it’s important for the sunglasses part.

The first time I met my neighbor, we had a casual talk about our kids being the same age. He also apologized for planting privacy shrubs between our homes, which I thought was a nice gesture. We parted ways on good terms.

The second time got awkward. I was outside when his wife and son were in their backyard, so I greeted her, and we chatted for a bit. Then the husband came over, wearing sunglasses with a serious look. Now, I want to clarify that I have childhood trauma related to people wearing sunglasses, so it’s not an ableist thing—I just find it uncomfortable. When someone wears sunglasses, I can’t make good eye contact, and it makes it hard to feel like I’m having a real talk. I don’t mind if others wear them, but I tend to avoid eye contact when they do, and it can make talks feel off for me. I ended up talking mostly to his wife because I couldn’t look him in the eyes with the sunglasses on.

At one point, he said, “You should get back to your unpacking,” and then walked away with his wife and son. Later, I apologized to him for some other lawn issues and told him that if he had any questions or problems, he could reach out, but he seemed distant. Since then, we’ve had very little contact. There’s been some passive-aggressive behavior, like him mowing too far under his lawn line (even after I had it surveyed with flags). They also don’t wave or greet us when we’re outside anymore. I’ve tried to start a talk a few times, but he just turned and walked away. His wife also seems to get busy and heads inside when I step outside.

What’s also been odd is that I’ve noticed he wears sunglasses a lot when he’s outside, but he makes an effort to take them off when talking to other people. For example, when he had his parents over, he was fine spending hours outside without sunglasses, and when a new neighbor moved in, he took his sunglasses off right away to greet them. So it feels like, for some reason, he left them on when talking to me that day. I don’t know if he was upset that I talked to his wife first, which made him feel territorial, or if he’s just confirming some bias he might have about me (I’m not white while he is, btw), but it seems like an intentional choice to make our talks feel more distant.

This might not matter much in the long run (hopefully), but my wife, who hasn’t noticed any of this, found out that the neighbor’s wife is pregnant and wants to stop by and give them a gift. Now, I’m wondering if this will cause more drama or make things even more awkward if this issue isn’t fixed.

531,1jrhvm8,Asshole,AITA IF I CANCEL ON MY ROLE AS BEST MAN,"Hey everyone I’m 23M with gf 21F. We have been dating for a few years. My sister has been dating someone also for 4 years and they had a small break up but got back together. Me and my gf broke up for a month but ended up getting back together.

She was planned to be in the wedding of my cousin. We do everything for these people, we surprise them, bring food and drinks to their house when we hang out and we hang out there or four times a week. We even sacraficed vacation time and potential earnings to help with their shower and engagement party. The set up took a few days.

Now my sister and her boyfriend will be in the wedding as a groomesman and brides maid. My girlfriend was also expected to be a bridesmaid. 

Well we had our little break up like 4 months ago and got together after 28 days. We are awesome together. Anyway my cousins want to remove her as a bridesmaid and still keep me as the best man. 


How can you remove her but still keep me. Would I be the AH if I decided not to be the best man? Any other tips on what I could do? I’m sure it would upset my entire family if I decided not to be the best man but my girlfriend who I plan on marrying is more important to me and I’ll choose her iver them.

532,1jrhmts,Asshole,AITA for texting my BBF to not play predent that we are BFFs because she won't go to my bachelorette party.,"

      I am going to have a wedding in june. 2 of my  BBFs (out of 3) cannot go to my bachelorette party. I learned about this from other participant (sister in law form my fiance's side) because she didn't want me to be sad on the day. 
    These two friends won't be attending my wedding becasue they're traveling at the time (for student job). But we talked a lot about my b. party. 
     When my sisters in law (from my and fiance's side) started plannig my b. party (from what i know it was this week) they said that they cannot go. One (lets call her Jane) said she doesn't have one free weekend (until her travel's) so she can't go. Second one said she at the time will be already gone (i don't know when she leaves). 
      When my sister in law yesterday told me I cried, becasue I expected them to come and plan the event and was just shocked...(in past we talked about maybe making one for only us BBFs if they didnt want to come with my family). 
     I tried to include them in other wedding stuff - not too much, I dont want to be bridezilla, but i asked them if they would come to trial of my w. dress - they said yes. When the date was set they said they are not going. This is only to explain what and why i reacted how i reacted. 
    I texted Jane, asking her if she was attending my wedding (becasue she wasn't sure before). So she said no (with apology). So i asked her about the b. party... she said she can't go because she is either traveling on weekends until the wedding or she has to study for finals. So i told her i would rather to hear this from her than my sister in law. She apolozied and said that the date wasn't set and she wasn't sure and also said that she wanted to wait until our meeting next week (we didint make the plan for sure) . 
     Becasue of this I was confused (these are for me 2 contradictery statments) and got mad - I texted her that I don't know what to tell her, that I feel like all the things that include me and doing something for me are not that imopotant for them, and that we don't have to predent to be BFFs if we are crealy not and that i was dissapointed, but that I understand. She left me on read. Now I feel even worse. AITA for texting her this?

533,1jrgix7,Everyone Sucks,AITA For making my friend anxious on purpose?,"My (22M) friend (21F) recently came to me saying that whenever something new happens in her life, she feels the need to tell me right away and she gets anxious if she doesn’t. I definitely wouldn’t want her to feel this way, so i asked her what could be causing this anxiety but she had no idea.

  
In the pursuit to help her, i brought up something that happened in the past. I reminded her that near the beginning of our friendship she would nag me and write “bad things” about me in her private tumblr blog and would never tell me what they were. This caused me anxiety, so i told her that sometimes I would purposely tell her that I was writing something about her in my notes, when in reality there was nothing bad to write about, just so she would understand what she was doing to me.

  
After telling her this, she said she no longer trusts me and doesn’t believe that a real friend would do that to her. She said that she never intended for it to cause me anxiety, but I was the one that did it on purpose for revenge. I told her that it was a short sighted mistake and I didn't think it would've affected her so much. I told her  that I definitely regret doing something so immature instead of just talking to her, but also that she had done the same to me so i didn’t understand why she was so angry, even though she says it wasn't on purpose she still did it.

  
This conversation happened 4 days ago and we are no longer friends according to her and have barely talked since. I really wanna be her friend because she has been there for me always and I have been there for her. We've been through a lot together so I would hate for it to end like this. AITA for causing my friend anxiety by lying to her?"
534,1jrg0lc,Not the A-hole,AITA for canceling several plans after a work friend lied about being confused over which shift she was covering?,"Hi fellow Redditors,

So here's the sitch. Both me and the friend are over 35 years old and work for a major airline. I am a gay dude. Sometimes when our schedules are published, we will agree to trade our trips around amongst friends. I messaged this friend and offered her a trip with a nice layover, and she agreed she would take it. two days later, when trading became available, I sent her the trip as soon as the system opened and followed up via text to let her know to pick it up. she attempts to pick it up - then makes clear that she can't because she was awarded a trade with a different system that was for a trip (conveniently) she had really wanted but wasn't able to hold outright. I know, complex - but would have had to have been something she did consciously for it to happen.

I point out that she could trade out of the trip, and could then pick up the trip she'd committed to from me - she refuses, then said ""she really wants this trip"" and assumed that I had been referring to a different trip on my schedule. I did push back and said she'd agreed to take this trip, and that in the future if we agree on something like this I'd expect her to follow thru. I looked back in our texts - there was no way she could have been confused because she confirmed the trip date in our text conversation. I SO DISLIKE BEING GASLIT.

We were supposed to have dinner later that week, which I'd intended on going thru with and having a discussion with her about this - I ended up being filled with anxiety that day and had to cancel a few hours prior, which I did feel badly about just because I didn't want to waste her evening. During this entire time - I have also been experiencing some serious GI issues for months  which ended up with a visit to the emergency room a few weeks back.

We'd made plans to go on a trip - but given this health issue and her dishonesty, I made clear (several weeks out) that I would likely be unable to go, today I confirmed my unavailability. She's since been very distant and when I mentioned being unable to go the first time even said ""I haven't even looked to see if I got the days off"", as if she doesn't even care we had plans OR that I had booked a hotel using my free night award to do so and asking for nothing from her in return.

I have been a good friend to this person, supporting them thru a roommate situation she was very upset about, answering long winded texts voicing her frustration, basically being an emotional tampon. driving this person around to view different neighborhoods, even looking at the place they moved into and assisting them in getting a little bit off the rent (which was inflated). AITA for withdrawing given this kind of behavior on her end?"
535,1jrftm8,Not enough info,AITA for not allowing EX to use my car to see his family?,"I (30F) just purchased my first ever car!!! My ex (28M) and I share 2 young children together, and although not together I’ve also recently paid off a hefty fine to have his license unsuspended so that he can also utilise said car in obtaining his license and to generally do better in his life, I will also be paying for some tickets (a couple grand worth) so that he can be fully qualified in a previous profession he had, this will also mean that he will be able to work in the mines and make money for not only himself but also our kids.
The car is mine, I paid for it outright with my money, but I am all for him using it for our kids & to help with his employment.
He has been making a lot of comments about driving to see his family, he’s got family in the same city, and I don’t mind him taking our kids to see them but he’s specifically made loose plans to see a family member who is a 10 hour round trip north of us and other family members who are an 36 hour round trip south.
I told him I won’t allow him to use my car to travel so far to see his family. All of the people that he has plans on visiting have been to our town before to see him and the kids, the relative who is 5 hours away comes a few times a year and the ones who are 18 hours away have visited once each while our children have been in our lives. 
He got defensive and questioned why I wouldn’t allow our kids to see their family members. I told him I wasn’t restricting our kids from seeing their family, I was saying no to using my car to travel such long distances there & back.
This turned into a heated discussion, I really felt like I had a completely valid point, and he disagreed and continued to question my reasoning. 
Here’s where I may be the AH: eventually after being constantly questioned about my decision I snapped and explained to him that he has said numerous times he wants to work on our relationship but does nothing to actually work on it. My car is an investment I made, the upkeep, the km’s is on me. If I’m not invested in him as a partner because he cannot work on the relationship then I’m not going to waste km’s on my car for him to see his. 
Obviously he felt attacked, but I just don’t think it’s unreasonable. He will be using my car to better his life, so will I… having a car obviously opens a lot of different job opportunities as well as recreational activities with the children. I’m already putting money into him for him to be able to advance in a career that’s going to take care of himself and our kids financially. I just don’t think I have to let this man drive my car such long distances to see his family. Hell, if and when he does start working in his previous profession, within 2 months he will probably have enough to buy a decent car for himself anyway! 
I’m feeling a little gaslit here, maybe manipulated, idk… he said to me “tell your family this and see what they say” I know they would say it’s my car so my decision, but I wanted to know AITA? 

Edit: some ppl were unnecessarily rude but I’m grateful for the majority who opened my eyes to the situation.
To add, I genuinely thought I was doing something beneficial, I thought well because he’s the father of my kids why can’t I help him succeed for the betterment of our kids. I fully accept that while I have good intentions I am ultimately enabling him.
My only motivation in this is my kids futures, that’s all. I will add, he is a terrific dad to them, maybe I didn’t clarify in the original post but he does have a job right now, I see his money go towards the kids… I just knew he didn’t have the extra funds to be able to get his license and get his tickets so I thought I was doing a good thing in helping him with that, again to clarify I offered to do this because I thought it was the right thing to do. 
In doing so I’ve clearly blurred lines and allowed him to feel entitled to what I have and to manipulate me in certain situations.
I will be telling him I will NOT be paying for his tickets.
I will allow him to drive the car for the sole purpose of the kids, this means he will not be using the car for personal trips, like seeing his family. 
I don’t think there’s really a right way to do anything in this situation, but I am trying my best. 

Think I’ve got what I needed, thanks.

The lector scheduler sends out a text asking for dates we aren't available to serve, and includes the Deacon in the thread. I replied that I'm not available to serve for both EM & lector on the first & last weekends of this month. I received the lector half of the schedule, and then a text from one of the other EM volunteers with questions about the EM schedule. She sent it to me, and I'm scheduled to serve as EM this weekend.

537,1jrfk58,Not the A-hole,AITA for not paying my roommate double?,"I (20M) burrowed $11 from my roommate (17M). Yesterday, he wanted to spend his money, but I had spent it yesterday. I get paid on Saturday so I didn't think it was a big deal. but last night before bed, he walks over to me saying I owe him $22 for spending his money. Now this wouldn't be a big deal normally, but here's the thing, I already offered to give his money multiple times over last weekend. He can't use Cash app because he's a minor, which is why I was holding it. I would have had no problem paying double if I had been given a ""have by this time"" date , and didn't have it so I have to pay double. My problem is I already tried giving it to him, but he can't hold it, so I just held it until he wanted it, but the one day I didn't have it he says I suddenly owe double. Not only that, he all but demanded it from me, like he was part of the cartel or something, just disrespectful for no real reason. However I do feel like an asshole, cause I did spend his money, even if he couldn't hold it. So Reddit, AITA?

Edit: we are at trade school and are NOT in a apartment.

Edit 2:

 I had owed him 11$ on since last Thursday, offered his money back fri-sun. He doesn't want it at the moment (for some reason). I hold on to it till yesterday when I spend it. I get back to the dorms and he suddenly wants the money right in the moment, but I don't have it right now, and wont till Saturday. He gets mad and tells me I now owe him $22 as if I was supposed to have it on Thursday, which we did not agree on. I simply owe him $11 until he can take it. I tried paper cash, doesn't want it. I tried sending it to a friend of his whose cashapp does work, doesn't want me to do it. So after a week, I spend the money, and now here we are."
538,1jrff8l,Asshole,AITA for not telling telling my friend one of our other friends is mad at her,"Basically both of my close friends are going through it but not communicating with each other. Let’s call them Marie and Kim. Kim cut themselves off from the friend group over feeling undervalued. I thought they were even mad at me, which me and Marie both felt and were discussing why she may be upset for the last few days. Kim ended up calling me, explaining she just feels she doesn’t find a lot of the people on the friend group being genuine friends, including Marie. I tried to convince her to maybe talk it out with Marie, especially since she’s already getting the vibe Kim is mad at her. Yet, Kim said she doesn’t want to and that she’d prefer I don’t get involved.

The next day Marie calls me, asking if I talked to Kim to see how she’s doing. I did say I talked to her but made no mention of what she told me about being upset with her and other friends of ours. Even when Marie asked if Kim mentioned her, I lied and said no. I feel horrible though! AITA for lying? I just don’t know how wise it would be to tell her that Kim did mention she’s upset."
539,1jrersb,No A-holes here,AITA for not being more supportive while my FIL is about to die?,"Sorry if this is too long, I just don’t want to miss any context. 

My FIL was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer back in September. We knew he had less than a year. 

Since then, my husband has spent every single night FaceTiming his dad while I’d chase after our toddler by myself for most of the evening. Our weekends were spent at his parents’ house (they live 2 hours away across the border in Canada). So we’ve essentially spent 0 time alone together for 6 months, and most evenings I feel like a single mother. 

Throughout this time, his father is just slowing decaying. He needs way more attention and care than my toddler. So, when we visit, I am alone with my child again while my husband, his mother, and his sisters are all tending to his father. 

Before his father got sick, we were talking about trying for baby #2. I wanted to wait until his father passed, because selfishly I was thinking of what a difficult time it would be to be pregnant while chasing after a toddler alone, my husband grieving, the whole family grieving, etc. My reasoning to my husband was I didn’t want him to feel torn between two families, and when I’m pregnant, I will need him with us*, but right now his father needs him. He insisted everything would be fine, and finally I caved and got pregnant in January.    

All that said, his father has decided to end his life this coming Monday. 

My husband is not handling it well, and is already grieving a loss that hasn’t happened yet. He does not handle loss well. 

Yesterday and today he has asked me to leave work early to go pickup our daughter so he can go home and drown in his sorrows. This weekend and all of next week, I fully anticipate doing everything on my own and leaving him be, because I can’t tell someone how to grieve. 

My problem right now, and where I might be an AH, is I’m arguing with him for grieving “in advance” before it has even happened yet, and he swore to me months ago (when I didn’t want to get pregnant yet) that I wouldn’t be left to pickup the pieces.

Now he’s telling me I’m not being understanding or sympathetic when he’s about to lose his father. 

So, AITA?


 ETA: I appreciate all of the criticisms, truly. Upon further reflection, I’ve realized this stems from my job. Since this diagnoses, I’ve been demoted and later “warned” about missing so much work. I’m terrified at the thought of losing my job while pregnant with a second baby. Perhaps my priorities are out of whack, but it’s a very real fear and it’s driving me to be resentful which is absolutely misplaced. 

I’m not going to bash my husband, but we have literally argued about my feeling sick (due to pregnancy) and not watching our daughter closely enough while he’s on a FT call. Little things like this have also played a role in my anxiety and stress.

Also, I didn’t include any notes of ‘having sympathy’ overall for my husband, my in-laws, or my dear FIL because I didn’t think it was relevant to the question I was posing. I guess my tone made me sound a lot worse. "
540,1jre7np,Not the A-hole,WIBTA I (21M) want to move out of my parents (50M & 50F) house?,"I'm currently living at home and want to move out because of some struggles I've had with my parents. They help pay for my college, my car, and my phone and use those things as pawns to pressure me to do what they want me to. I was dating a girl for more than a year and they disliked her so much that they threatened to take away my phone, car, and college payments. To add a little more to the story, I had lied to my parents about some things in regards to my relationship, and that just made things worse. I also broke some of the rules that my parents had asked me to follow when dating. I ended up breaking up with her 4 weeks ago because I couldn't afford to have those things taken from me, and I thought my life would get better without her. My ex knew that my parents were manipulative and so last week she came to check on me at school and ask if things at home were okay. 

I felt guilty for seeing her (because of my parents) but didn't want to be rude, so we talked for an hour about things at home. My ex then told my little sister that she saw me and when my little sister came home from college this past weekend she was cornered by my mom. Eventually the story of my ex coming to see me reached my mom and everything blew up. My parents were livid that I had seen her and not told them, and that I had lied to them about not being in contact with her after we broke up. So they decided to ground me, take away my phone and take away my car. 

So now I'm over living at home and am considering students loans or pausing my school so that I can move out, get a car, a phone and be financially independent. I feel guilty for wanting to leave because I'm the only son and I know the emotional pain that it would cause my parents for me to move out right now. AITA if i move out after I lied to my parents and they handed out punishment? "
541,1jrdk6v,Not the A-hole,AITA If I (F21) ask my roommate (F21) to pay me back the $150 I gave her?,"My roommate and I moved into our apartment with two others in August 2024. She and I split the payment to have a cat here, $300 total. We are only allowed one cat, but we both wanted to have ours here. We had her cat as the one registered, as my cat is my ESA and we figured we could fight the leasing company if they found her. However, in November my cat began peeing outside of her litter box so I took her back to my parents house until we could figure out what was wrong with her and she stopped misbehaving. Immediately after I returned her home, my roommate got another cat. It’s been months and anytime I mention bringing my cat back she gets quiet or starts being mean about her peeing on the carpet (even though her new cat has also peed on the carpet multiple times). I feel bad asking for my money back, as I know she has to pay for her tuition and rent all by herself, whereas I have a savings account made by my family when I was a baby that pays for that for me. But I still don’t think it’s fair that I paid her $150 to have my cat here, and I don’t even have her anymore and they don’t want me to bring her back either. I don’t know what to do. "
542,1jrdenu,Not the A-hole,AITA for yelling at my mom for eating peanut butter in her own house?,"My daughter (2.5) was diagnosed with peanut allergies (and pistachios and cashews) a year ago. She became almost unconscious, vomitted, and landed us in the ER (not anaphylactic). It was terrifying to see my baby go through that. I love my mom so much. We're really close. And she loves my daughter like crazy. Ever since the diagnosis, everyone in my family has been in agreement to not eat those nuts around her. It seems so obvious and easy to my brothers, and my dad, but my mom keeps making what I think are dumb decisions. When we go on vacation, she will go out of her way to bring big bags of nuts and nut candy with her. She brought a little bag of pistachios when she stayed at my house one time and started shelling and eating them in my living room after my daughter went to sleep. She bought peanut m&ms to eat on a plane ride we all took together. On these occasions, I kept my cool as I asked her not to do these things and pointed out the ridiculousness of her having to eat the one thing that my daughter is allergic to. Well, we've been staying at her house for the past few days and this morning my mom was eating a sandwich, my daughter went over and asked for a bite, and my mom said ""sorry sweetie, you can't have this it's peanut butter."" And I kind of completely lost my shit. I asked her calmly why she was eating peanut butter and she said ""I don't know"" as she dumped it in the garbage. And then I kind of lost it. I got very emotional and raised my voice (something I never do.) and I chewed her out for always eating nuts around my daughter even though she knows she's allergic, even though I've asked her not to multiple times. I told her I want to trust her so badly to watch my daughter without me there, but I just don't. I can't. And then I cried and stormed out of the room. Anyways..AITA for yelling at my mom in her own house over this?

TLDR: I yelled at my mom for eating peanut butter in front of my daughter who is allergic."
543,1jrcvd9,Everyone Sucks,WIBTA If I prioritizined myself over my best friend's wedding?,"Me(16F) and my best friend(18F) have been bestfriends for 5 years but I moved to a different country this year and plan to stay there for a very long time. Nevertheless, I plan on being her best friend forever and she shares that sentiment. We were talking online the other day about meeting up again in the future and we started talking about relationships and marriage.  Yes, we are far off from that but we were just excited for each other's presence in our future lives/events. She mentioned she would invite me if she ever had a wedding and I said I would readily fly across any country to attend it  but then a thought cross my mind and I stupidly voiced it out that I wouldnt be able to go if there was an important event coming up that day. The important event I mentioned was 'A better job opportunity' or something similar. The chances of that happening were so low I don't even know why I said it.  
  
She told me that she understood the need to better my life/career but she couldnt believe I would actually choose something like that over her wedding isince it only happened once but opportunities could show up later on. Thats why I told her it would be a good idea to let me know if she was ever going to have a wedding in advance. I was very sincere about it when I said it and I really would find this situation to be unpleasent if it happened since I've heard of people not being able to attend their friend's wedding because they mentioned it too late.  
  
She told me that if she were in my shoes she'd have chosen my wedding and I asked if she was upset. She said she was just dissapointed and her messages became shorter and less frequent for a while after that. That always happens when shes upset. Everything went back to normal when i messaged her the next day. Since we're bestfriends we do fight over silly things from time to time but I really felt like an asshole for saying that especially when she said she'd do more for me.

Given that I already told her about my dreams, I thought she would understand it when I said I'd prioritize an opportunity to better my career.  This whole explanation is so silly because it was just a hypothetical situation and I proposed a solution so it wouldnt but I feel like that still hurt her. And it makes me feel like I'm not putting as much importance into our friendship as she would.

And now I have two questions. Am I an Asshole for having this mindset?   
Would I really be the asshole if I chose a job opportunity over her wedding? "
544,1jrcst6,Not the A-hole,AITA- prom makeup fiasco,"The history: My sister and I don’t get along. I think she resents me because my childhood was easier than hers. (When my mom divorced/stopped taking care of her adult child(my dad) there was more time, love, and resources for me. 
So, our relationship has always been a struggle. We have had blow out fights that never really resolved-just got pushed under the rug. I find that she is completely unable to be vulnerable or admit her own faults. So, we have a shallow, civil, relationship (at best) that is completely on her terms. I basically walk on eggshells trying to not accidentally offend or annoy her. Regardless, I have always tried to be a doting aunt- partly for my nieces, partly for me, and partly as an olive branch to my sister.

The situation:  
My oldest niece (16y) is going to her first prom.  I offered to do her make up (test run before prom) because as a theatre major, I took two make up classes- learned how to contour and do corrective makeup. My niece doesn’t wear ANY make up so I knew I would definitely need to go easy- definitely not a full face of stage make up- but rather, a subtle color correction and slight contour blend. Hardly any eye makeup (as per request). 
I told her a story about how I didn’t speak up during my prom twenty years ago and I ended up with a hairstyle I hated. I emphasized this over and over so that she would feel comfortable telling me what she liked and didn’t like. I told her it wouldn’t hurt my feelings if she didn’t like it. (I didn’t make the make up!) All I wanted was for her to speak up and for us to be on the same page.

Well, she’s 16. She didn’t speak up. And acted like she liked it while she was with me and then sends me a vague text saying she’ll let me know if she needs me.  I find out from my mom who talked to my sister that she and my sister thought the make up was “too much”.

I know I said it wouldn’t hurt my feelings- but it did.  I’m not offended that a 16 year old is afraid of some foundation. I’m offended that no one could be honest with me so that I could EASILY tone it down and fix it. 

It’s just a reminder that anytime I try to have a *real* or honest  conversation with anyone in this family, it is just impossible.  

Ok so I am the asshole for letting this hurt my feelings. But what do I do/say? Should I just ignore it and act like it didn’t hurt my feelings since I said it wouldn’t? 




"
545,1jrckfw,Asshole,"AITA for being ""too honest"" with my friends?","Lately, I’ve been worried that I might be turning into the kind of friend who uses “honesty” as an excuse to say harsh things. I’ve seen people justify being mean by calling it “just being real,” and it scares me to think I might come off that way. I never insult my friends or say things just to hurt them, but I do try to be realistic and logical, especially when I feel like someone isn’t thinking clearly or might make a decision they’ll regret. Still, I’ve been called negative—mostly by one close friend. We used to be best friends, and although we’ve drifted a little, we’re still very close. It didn’t bother me much until a recent fight.

We’re both 19, and out of nowhere, she told our friend group that she had asked her mom to start finding potential rishtas (marriage proposals). I was surprised—she’s always talked about wanting to get married, but I assumed it would be after we graduated university. We haven’t even finished 13th grade yet. So my first response was simply, “Why do you want to get married right now?” She started arguing that she’s not getting married immediately—just planning to get engaged within a year. She called me negative, told our other friend to talk to her privately, and basically shut me out of the conversation. That’s when I got a little aggressive in response and lashed out on her.

We haven’t talked properly since. We met once in a group setting, and she tried telling us about a rishta she received from a 25-year-old in the group chat after we met irl. I had calmed down by then, but didn’t know what to say and waited for our other friend to reply first. When she did, my friend said to her, “Should’ve just told you privately.” I got pissed off and replied, “Should have then,” and the conversation ended there. We didn't talk for a WHILE. 

Her rishta got finalized (as in she’s gonna marry this 25-year-old), so I sent her a message saying, “Ik we aren’t on the best terms rn but congrats, I’m happy for you” (I’M NOT. I THINK THIS IS A HORRIBLE DECISION, but everyone told me to stfu and just be happy about it in front of her). She replied, “Thank you🤍"" and we haven't talked since then. I realised she removed me from her close friends too and we actively ignore each other on the group chat. I have been on a vacation so we haven't hung out irl since then.

I don’t know if I’m just the asshole friend who uses “honesty” to be an asshole. I certainly feel like it rn. A part of me feels like she should have expected this reaction from me, knowing how anti-marriage I am—especially young marriages, especially young marriages with an age gap. But a part of me feels like, being her close friend, I should’ve just supported her and not tried to be “logical” or “realistic.” But I feel like I’m going crazy with how everyone is acting like this is normal. I know it’s normal in Pakistan, but marriage has ruined the life of every woman me and her know, so it’s crazy she wants this. Or am I just an asshole who can’t be happy for her friend? I don’t know.


Update: Ty to everyone who gave valuable insight into this and helped me realise why I was in the wrong. I apologised to her and we talked it out and everything is fine now. I think I should j learn tact a bit because I've always been someone who's very blunt and upfront with my opinions but as I grow up I'm realising that's not the right option in a lot of situations. Some of u rlly are crazy tho lmao no I didn't completely ruin our friendship because I messed up once things happened I reacted wrong and then she got hurt and reacted back. We both apologised and talked things out. "
546,1jrbqtf,Not enough info,AITA for confronting my girlfriend?,"I recently had an argument with my girlfriend as I sensed that she had changed the way she treated me or talked to me, she’s started opening up to me less, she was more enthusiastic about our relationship before, she used to prioritize me more before and she used to flirt a lot more than she does now. So when I noticed the change I wanted to talk to her about it but she kept delaying the argument, she doesn't really like deep conversations or sharing what she felt, she often says that she isn't in the mood for deep talks, so every time i wanted to talk about something bothering me she would just tell me to forget about it. The same thing happens when she’s clearly upset about something I did but won’t tell me what it is and tells me to ignore it. I told her that I’ve had enough, and told her straight that she wasn't validating my feelings and that it started to feel like a one sided relationship, I told her I was very upset that I was the only one willing to try to fix things. After I texted her that message she said that everything I said was valid and I had every right to say what I said. She said was willing to try to change her ways, and told me that the reason she started treating me differently is because she started to have some thoughts that she didn't want to share with me, not because she doesn't care about me, but because she's not sure about them. I felt bad for telling her how I felt at that moment, I think it was somewhat selfish and unfair.

So, AITA?"
547,1jrbk10,No A-holes here,AITA (23M) when my girlfriend (21F) makes me responsible for her sleep,"We’ve been together for 3+ years. We’ve been getting into arguments because she apparently can’t sleep if we don’t talk before bed.

But she says that she gets bothered that we don’t talk before bed, i’ve suggested to her why doesn’t she talk about something. 

Am I overreacting or wrong for even slightly being upset about this, the problem is that she points fingers and likes to blame me or at least make me responsible for her not sleeping.

Maybe i’m the asshole for getting upset about this and arguing, but my response is always “What do you want to talk about” It’s never along the lines of “Well why don’t you just go to bed” or “Well th"
548,1jrabuv,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my friend it's illegal to claim she's a realtor when she doesn't have a real estate license?,"My (30F) friend ""Suzy"" (29F) recently told me she's been representing herself as a licensed agent and realtor to people despite not having completed the licensing exam. She works with a licensed broker named Bob who handles the legal aspects of transactions, but she's still telling people she's a realtor without having the credentials.

When I saw a text where she admitted this, I told her that misrepresentation is illegal and that falsifying a license is a serious offense. I explained that this could potentially get both her and Bob in trouble, since ""Realtor"" is actually a protected term for members of the National Association of Realtors.

She got defensive and said ""I don't care"" and that ""It's not really a lie"" and ""It's so minor."" She claims she's just using the term to make their ""brand sound more legit"" and that she's ""not proactively saying she's a realtor to people in town."" But in an earlier message, she clearly said ""Yes"" when I asked if she's telling people she's a realtor. And she was sending a text to her friend reminding him that she is a realtor. She also has stated on their brokerage website that she “got her license in 2024.” I recently saw this and said you need to edit that out because you can’t tell people you’re a licensed agent, and she said she was planning to take it out.

She eventually messaged saying it seems like she “struck a nerve” and that she's not doing anything that ""puts Bob or our business at risk"" because she's ""not handling deals or writing offers."" She ended by saying ""Lol i dont care"" when I reminded her that misrepresentation and falsifying a license is illegal.

I feel like I was just looking out for her by warning about potential legal consequences, but she's acting like I'm being ridiculous and overreacting. It makes me feel sick to imagine my friend deceiving people like this, and to have complete disregard for the rules. To me, there is zero benefit to her lying.

549,1jr8fmo,Not the A-hole,AITA for losing my temper with a friend after he made comments I found offensive about my country (Mexico)?,"AITA for losing my temper with a friend after he made comments I found offensive about my country (Mexico)?

I (Mexican, living abroad for ~5 years) have a close group of local friends I’ve been hanging out with for the past 3 years. Yesterday, we went to a bar after a long day of university critiques, where professors give open feedback to students in front of everyone.

We started talking about another Mexican student who got very defensive after receiving criticism and ended up arguing with a professor. I didn’t agree with how he reacted, but I tried to explain to my friend that there’s a cultural difference — in Mexico, critiques are usually more indirect or softened, not so blunt.

My friend replied that if people can’t accept criticism, then “everything must be shit.” That already made me uncomfortable, but I tried to explain again that it’s not about avoiding criticism, just expressing it differently. Then he said, “Just because there are cartels and no freedom of speech in Mexico doesn’t mean you can’t speak your mind.”

That really hit a nerve. I interrupted him with a sharp “No. No. No. No.” — I admit, in an aggressive tone. I felt like he was reducing my entire culture to narcos and censorship. My family and close friends back in Mexico have suffered from the violence. It’s part of the reason I left. Hearing that from someone I considered a close friend made me feel deeply hurt and misunderstood.

He got mad at how I spoke to him and started getting personal. I don’t even remember what he said, because I was emotionally shut down. I left the bar without saying goodbye. Later, a friend texted me saying things had gotten awkward and everyone had left.

At around 3am, the friend I argued with messaged me saying he didn’t understand why I got upset, implied I had a bigger issue with him, and told me I made him look like the bad guy, which hurt him coming from a close friend.

I responded, explained my perspective, and even said I didn’t believe he meant to offend me, but that he lacked tact and that his words deeply hurt me. I apologized for my tone and said we could talk in person if he wanted. I also said my opinion of him hadn’t changed. His only reply was: “Honestly, I don’t understand.”

So… AITA?

TL;DR:
A friend made insensitive comments about Mexico during a conversation about cultural differences in handling criticism. I lost my temper and left. Later, he said I overreacted and made him look bad. I apologized for my tone but explained why I was hurt. He still says he doesn’t understand. AITA?"
550,1jr88nk,No A-holes here,AITAH for wanting my brother to come to my birthday instead of letting him go to a concert w/ family,"I (16 m) have a brother (18 m not biologically related but we've known each other since 5 and 7) who lives out of state, who i don't get to see often. i have been talking to him abt purchasing him plane tickets to celebrate my birthday with me and a close friend for about 3 months.

my birthday is also a hard time for me, because my grandfather died on my 6th birthday. however i mostly play it of as though it doesn't hurt me. though i have told my brother in private that it does, especially thanks to other close people in my life and dear pets dying close to or on my birthdays. 

his mother bought him his step father and herself tickets to a concert in may, last month. my birthday is towards the end of this month, and i will be holding a small party in a hotel in a city in state, where we will also be visiting the local mall.

he stated yesterday that he may not be able to come due to the concert, which is out of state from where he lives and where I live. I had asked when it was and he stated it was next month, so I asked how the dates would conflict because we can either buy him tickets to the state he'll need to be in or just send him home from the airport in the city where visiting on our way back to our home town. he never answered my question (this was in a vc w/ me and the friend who would be coming w/ us) 

I feel he isn't being entirely honest with me abt why he might not come. now to where i may be the asshole; i texted him later that night telling him he didn't have to come if he didn't want to, but he doesn't need to make excuses.

 though if I'm being entirely honest I would be hurt if he didn't come, especially since its felt like he's been pushing me away for months (I've tried speaking to him abt this and he claims everything's fine) 

so, aitah?

551,1jr8652,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to go out with my friends because they got too drunk in the past?,"I (19f) have been friends with 3 girls, Mary (19f), Leah (20f) and Jane (20f), for about a year and a half. We met in college and got along really well, and I consider them to be some of my closest friends. 

That being said, we are pretty different. They are a lot more ""wild"" than I am (their words, not mine). I am a rather calm, cautious person, and don't really enjoy getting drunk, while they are self-proclaimed party animals. I do go out and drink, but always in a reasonable way, whereas they more often than not end up completely drunk. That of course never stopped us from being friends and I still go out to bars with them and have a great time, we just have fun differently. 

It was never an issue until recently. Three weeks ago, we went out as we normally do, but things went pretty bad. They all got extremely drunk, to the point where Jane and Mary passed out and Leah left the party without telling anyone and we found her asleep in a random corner 5 minutes away from the bar we were at, and she had thrown up on herself. Since I never get too drunk, it's sort of an unspoken rule that I'm there to take care of them if they drink too much, but normally that just meant holding their hair while they threw up in toilets, or calling a cab for them. 

So I had a really stressful time, having two friends that I needed to take care of and another one that I had to look for for over 30 minutes, and it completely ruined my night, when I was supposed to have fun and let go of my stress. The next day I told them that it was irresponsible of them to let me deal with it and to just expect that I'd take care of them, and that it couldn't happen again. I told them that I'd only go out with them if they were careful and reasonable. They all apologized and that was it. 

But a week ago they asked me to go out again, so I made them promise that it wouldn't end up in the same way. Well, it did. Jane left with a random guy without saying anything and Leah was so drunk that we had to carry her from the cab to her house. Mary wasn't too drunk but still, it was super stressful again and I had to take care of them. The next day I got angry at them because they had promised it wouldn't happen again, and told them that from now on I wouldn't be going out with them anymore. 

Yesterday they asked me to come to a party with them and I said no, and said that I had plans to go out with other friends. They got really upset and said that I was unfair, especially since I was still going out with other people. I explained that those people never did the same things they did which was why I was comfortable going out with them. They're now saying that I'm not a good friend for not wanting to help them and that I'm being too uptight. I know that I might be ""not fun"" for this but also it's really not a fun time for me anymore and if I go out it's to have fun not to look after three passed out drunk people... But I really don't want this to ruin our friendship. I don't know what to do. "
552,1jr85ss,Not the A-hole,AITA to complain to my housemate,"I share an apartment with a gay guy who is so pedantic. He complains about everything. If I speak on the phone past a certain time, if I don't recycle, if I don't squeeze out the dish sponge, he folds my clothes when he thinks they are dry enough and he has complained about the door closing (not slammed) late at night or if i leave early in the morning. 

I feel like i am constantly on tenderhooks. 

  
The issue is - he has a friend staying with him now for a few days from his home country. I met this friend last year, hes fine. However, he arrived yesterday, he is loud, theyre loud together, theyre taking up the entire area downstairs, shoes and different things are strewn around and his housemate snores. 

  
Being honest, I dont really mind, people are human and not robots, but I know he would pull me up on this immediately, no question. I dont even have friends over during the day as one time my boyfriend was having dinner with me, my housemate was really put out we were in the kitchen, although he did not say anything. 

  
also, i am in the final days of my final semester of law. its an intense time. 

  
I kind of want to say it to him, to check or at least inform me, if people are going to be staying here as it is common courtesy, but aita because the only reason i want to say something is because he would say it to me?

Alright so for preference of how this all happened and we no longer became friends, so I during games would tell this friend that we should hangout and that but I would always end up with my other friends who the one specific person in the group let's call  A, 

he does not like her because he had a really bad falling out with her. But from that, that would happen And they were getting upset by it which would make me feel bad ofc so I tried explaining to them that I get to see them a lot compared to friend A who I never get to hangout with which really upset them cause I didn't get to see or hangout with them much either but it was still a lot more compared to friend A but the thing that caused him to stop being friends with me was when I went with friend A and that friend group during Halloween instead of them, but the reason for this being that way ahead I made plans with them to go trick or treating but they told me they would have to see if they could and I kept asking and bringing up and they would always tell me they haven't asked yet, 

so it was the day before Halloween and I went to this friends house, because they made my Halloween costume for me, and they asked me while I was there, who I was going with for Halloween, and I reluctantly told them that I was going with friend A when I told them, they got mad at me, of course and later that night over text told me that he want to no longer be friends with me, so AITA?(Sorry if the grammar and that is still bad)"

The problem here is that I love my sister and while I really appreciate what she went through to get the tickets...I want to enjoy the concert with my best friend as well.

In NO WAY did I ask this of my sister. I didn't tell her to buy my best friend a ticket and I surely didn't ask her to loan her the money for it either. Both parties know this.

This is important because my best friend caught wind of us going (because I obviously tell her everything) and she also wants to go. She asked me to ask my sister what section we were going to be seated in, so of course I did, no harm, right? Wrong.

My sister responded with ""we'll be going in a big group so she wouldn't even be able to find seating near us anyways."". And believe me, it was a VERY blunt tone that i lowkey found rude. Like are you ticketmaster or StubHub? I don't think so. Please get your attitude in check, and just tell me you'd rather not have her there!!

TLDR; my sister bought us (myself and her) concert tickets as my bday present but she's been super sus abt the entire process. She bought them from her friend without telling me we were going to be going WITH her friends that I don't like.

555,1jr6uc3,Not the A-hole,AITAH for not paying for my friends meal?,"alright, so recently an old friend of mine reached out saying she no longer wanted to be friends, alright cool, we were growing distant anyway. but she had told my other friend (K) that the main reason she didnt want to be our friend was because, and i quote “didnt have the common courtesy to pay for her dinner” she says “its common courtesy, i didnt expect you guys to, shit happens and life is hard but still.” obviously she did want and expected us to, but what she left out was the fact me and that friend did show common courtesy: we showed up, had a gift, and offered to pay more than 3 times. We went: how should we pay, wanna split? Or i can pay for you and me? I can pay it or split, whatever works.

She had said no each time me and K (my other friend) offered to pay, and she said she would and K asked if she was sure and she said yes. So there goes that. But that was a month ago, she never brought it up until she called it off, but she never directly told ME that. Today me, K, and another friend, decided to go out to eat, for my other friends late birthday. Birthday girl and K (the other friend, not the ex friend.) made a joke and birthday girl said“i should post the dessert and say “thanks for paying for the whole meal” and k said she should do it, i thought it was funny but i said nothing about it because ya know they were joking BUT NOPE! They posted and i thought alright whatever. (We didnt pay for the whole thing, we offered to pay for birthday girls meal and she said no so we all split the check) but then when we get home the ex friend and her friend get pissed and post saying we should give her the money we owe for the dinner. Which is wild , so i reposted birthday girls post saying “lol bye, this is why we dont take things out of context” and then ex friend and her friend got all their accounts to spam like my post and im just annoyed, if shes that upset with us, she shouldve told BOTH of us, or called us out on our BS the day of! Was it rude for the way I approached splitting or asking who would pay?! Im almost tempted to say “hey, if the dinner still upsets you i can send the money, my half and yours” because its just getting out of hand and im just trying to let it go. Should i?! I guess im being a people pleaser and trying to keep the peace but its because im trying to move forward and it just seems this girl cant let anything go! Maybe she didnt hear or think of it as me offering to pay? It was genuinely to the point me and K literally put our cards and anything on the table, offering to pay. "
556,1jr6s3u,Not the A-hole,AITA I(21m) telling my friend to leave.,"I live in an apartment with a couple friends(all same age). We were hanging out and had another mutual friend over. It was all chill for a while until it was getting closer to being late. Around 1 am it was getting pretty late and I wanted to go to bed. They were watching the new switch and Mario kart previews and weren’t quite per se and around 2am I said I’m getting ready for bed and took a shower and was out and they were still here. And 3am hit and I was getting slightly annoyed and I said we need to wrap this up. He got visibly annoyed and was saying are you serious, you can’t sleep? Which I said no cus y’all are talking. This wasn’t one of those big apartments the living room is like 5 steps from the door to my room. Anyways he was gonna come over tomorrow and I said you’re gonna come over tomorrow anyways and he says he probably won’t anymore.
So am I the asshole with the way I told him to leave?"
557,1jr68rg,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my mom to pay to attend my wedding?,"My (f28) mom chose to abandon her parental rights when I was 10 months old to be with a man she met and move states away. She came back into my life when I was 4 (they broke up) and was in and out of my life my entire childhood. When she would come back into my life she was extremely abusive both emotionally and physically. My father was also not perfect, he was an alcoholic, I had been put into foster care a few times, and my mom never showed up to any of the court dates. 

When I was 14 she found God and remarried an extremely hardcore religious man she met at church. 

Her husband has always hated me, told me that I couldn’t live with them because I didn’t follow the path of God. They’ve never helped me with anything financially, she never even paid child support. 

Fast forward to two years ago, her and her husband have had 3 daughters (aged 12, 10, and 7 as of right now) my mom asks me to buy her restaurant for $25,000. It started to get to the point where she was begging me, trying to tell me that it was a great business investment, that she had so many offers and wanted to keep it in the family. She said I would be making $100,000 a year. She didn’t know her husband had texted me months earlier saying that their business was failing, and he wanted me to help them turn their business around. 

I told her I was sick of her only contacting me when she needed something. 

She then had my sisters to call me and leave me voicemails asking why I was ignoring them and wouldn’t come visit. 

I got engaged in June of last year and my fiancés family offered to put in $15,000 for the wedding, my dad matched that and my fiancé and I are putting in around $10,000. My fiancé has a huge family and I only have about ten people on my dad’s side. My mom found out about our wedding from Facebook and offered to fly out my aunts, her daughter, and both of my grandparents. They all live in Thailand so I was really grateful to be able to have them there, I’ve always had a pretty good relationship with them and wouldn’t be able to afford to pay for all of their flights here without her. I was ready to bury the hatchet just to have them attend. My dad’s family made it very clear that they didn’t want to pay for her and her family. I asked her if she could pay for just herself, her husband, and her family and she told me she could only give me $1,000 because she has to pay for her kids’ private school. With catering, bar, and rentals everything ends up being around $200-250 a person. When I told her this she said  that I should expect that everything else would be paid off by gifts from guests. 

I don’t want to seem ungrateful and selfish for telling my own mom and family that they can’t come to my wedding because they won’t give us enough money, but I really don’t want to have other people (especially my father) pay for her to be there when she’s never helped me with anything in the past. AITA for telling her she can’t come unless she gives us more money?

558,1jr5xj5,Not the A-hole,AITA for not taking my sisters back to our condo?,"We live on the 22nd floor. Our parents are out of the country right now. Have been for a couple of weeks. There was an earthquake a week ago. I(18) just grabbed my sisters(13 and 11) and ran down the fire escape. Called our mom who instructed us to drive to our aunt’s and stay there.

The next morning, I called the condo admin who said that our building doesn’t have any cracks and we can return. But our aunt didn’t want us to go home right away and asked me to stay for an extra couple of nights.

My sisters wanted to go home right away though. Stiff necks and backs from sleeping on the sofa. So I called my mom who told me it’s my call.

I ended up deciding to wait for an extra few days. Told them to stay at our aunt’s while I went to buy them a couple of pillows.

On the fourth day, I got a call from one of my friends at the condo saying that a team of engineers inspected the building and determined that it’s safe.

So I drove them back, checked with the admin and we moved back in. They are still talking about stiff backs though."
559,1jr4qus,Not the A-hole,AITA for not caring if my stepdaughter calls me ma?,"





I'm going to get judgement for part of the story so throwaway.





I (40F) have a stepdaughter (16F) from my husband's previous marriage. The story is that my husband cheated on his wife with me and left her to be with me. That was 12 years ago, and now we're still married. My stepdaughter and I have always had a surprisingly decent relationship considering the past. My stepdaughter spent 5 days out of the week at home with my husband and me. As a result, I would drive her to school, pack her lunch and help her with homework. I did this hoping she wouldn't hate me, and it worked. I am physically unable to have kids, so having a good relationship with my stepdaughter filled at least part of the void for me. Nonetheless I do understand she isn't my daughter. She came up with various nicknames for me throughout the years, mostly short versions of my actual names. She started calling me ""ma"" recently. Her explanation for doing so was to show me a little more respect. I'm ok with it. I know she still calls her actual mother ""mom."" But just because I was ok with it didn't mean her mom was though. When she heard my stepdaughter call me ma I could easily tell it ticked her off. She told my stepdaughter to not call me that and told me I should lecture my stepdaughter that I'm not her mother. I told her I don't really care what she calls me, since I don't control my stepdaughter. She was ticked off by this too but didn't say anything. 





I'd like to know if this interaction specifically makes me an asshole. I know the past was wrong but I genuinely do not see an issue with my stepdaughter choosing this nickname for me."
560,1jr4aiy,Not the A-hole,AITA for not going to see my mom before I move across the country?,"
My mom and I have always had a complicated relationship. She struggled with addiction and mental health, and for most of my childhood, she just… wasn’t there. And when she was around, I was more like her parent—waking her up, making sure there was food, holding everything together. I got kicked out during my junior year of high school and was straight-up homeless. People who weren’t even related to me took me in.

I’m the youngest and only girl. I have three older brothers. The two oldest have different dads. One doesn’t talk to her. The other only calls when he needs something. My Irish twin (less than a year apart) had the same dad as me. He clashed with my mom constantly because he held her accountable. He passed away at 27, and they were in a fight the day he died.

I, on the other hand, was the peacekeeper. I defended her even when I shouldn’t have. I wanted her to feel loved, to not be alone. But I always paid for it emotionally.

A few years ago, she left a long-term partner after things got dangerous. I supported her, paid for her hotel, even brought a friend to help her connect with resources. She said she was ready to get clean—but later admitted she had already lined up a hookup and relapsed that night. We didn’t talk for 8 months. She reached out saying she was sober and trying again. I wanted to believe her.

This year, she needed help with knee surgery. I quit my job and drove six hours to help. On the way, she admitted she’d been talking to someone from her past who I told her was my ONE hard boundary. This man has used her and reconnected her with drugs. I was angry. But I still stayed. Got her groceries. Helped her get set up with state care. Left when her surgery got postponed.

She ended up in a care facility, had a rough recovery, and even flatlined en route to the ER. She pulled through—but now wants to leave the facility early even though she’s not ready. It’s exhausting watching the same cycle over and over.

Meanwhile, I got a dream job across the country. My partner and I are moving for it. When I told her, she barely reacted. When I told her I graduated college (first in my family!), she said “oh congrats” and then immediately complained about a nurse. That hurt.

I was going to visit her before the move, but honestly? I don’t want to. I’m tired of always being the one who shows up. I want to spend time with the people who support me—who’ve celebrated me, shown up for me, and didn’t expect me to carry everything alone.
 I feel guilty. But for once, I’m choosing myself.

AITA for not going to see my mom before I move across the country?
"
561,1jr49u2,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my friend to stop spitting in public constantly?,"So, my friend has this habit (if we can even call it that) of spitting. Like, not once or twice, but literally every 2 minutes when we're walking outside or even just chilling on our uni ground. It’s not a “once in a while when you’re sick” thing—it’s all the time.

I’ve told her so many times that it’s not exactly the most pleasant thing to do in public, especially with how often and loudly she does it. The sound she makes is... well, let’s just say it's not the most discreet or polite thing to hear in a public space. I’m totally fine if she wants to do it in a bathroom or somewhere private, but not constantly on roads or right in front of people.

We’re close enough to be blunt with each other, so I do call her out, but she just brushes it off and says she needs to do it because she finds it gross to swallow it. Okay, fair—but can’t she carry tissues or spit into a bin or something?

People literally stare sometimes, and I’ve started getting embarrassed when I’m with her. She says I’m being dramatic and judgmental, and that it’s “natural.”

She’s honestly super sweet otherwise, and I love hanging out with her, but this one thing is kind of ruining the vibe.

AITA for constantly telling her to stop, even if she says she can’t help it?"
562,1jr48d8,Not the A-hole,AITAH for telling my sister I need to be home more with my family.,"So here is the deal a few years ago, my sister and her husband couldn't afford daycare for their 4 kids under 5. So I decided to help them out by watching their kids for free so they could work. My kids are older now, so it worked out well for almost two years. Now I'm getting burnt out and want to be home more. I am also getting tired of feeling underappreciated and taken advantage of. It's almost like it's expected now that I will do this the rest of my life. My sister also makes little comments about how I don't appreciate the things she does to make it easier on me, like getting the kids' clothes laid out for the day. I have to bite my touch to keep from saying these are your kids. I am just really tired and now almost want to stop all together. I love these kids, and she is saying in so many words I keep going or I won't see them at all. She never wants me to take them anywhere, including my house, so I can get anything done unless its an appointment they have to go to. I take them to all their appointments, and if I do go somewhere, she has had the nerve to say something about filling up their Explorer. I never drive that car unless I have her children, so it really makes me feel like this isn't worth my stress levels. I feel like an indentured servant all the time. I find I hate her house, and I'm not sure I'm not growing to hate her as well."
563,1jr43qh,Not the A-hole,AITA for not accepting my parent’s new partner,"My (16f) parents divorced when I was 12. Their marriage was rocky for years, so I wasn't surprised, but I was devastated about my dad moving out. Almost immediately, I was introduced to my mom's boyfriend. I already knew about him when I accidentally saw a gross text he sent my mom. I did not like him, and I was hesitant to even try to get along, even though ig he was nice enough. I know he was seeing my mom before she was divorced, and my mom talked to me about that, saying that by the point the marriage was already over. However, when I saw the text, from my perspective, my parents were still together and would be together. 

As the years have passed, I hate him a little more every time I see him. He's so childish, and insults my sister (24f)(even if he doesn't seem to think he does). When I was still young, my mom asked if she wanted me to break up with him, since I wasn't taking things well and was very bad mentally, but I said no because I love her and wanted her to be happy, even though I hated her dating someone so soon. I know he's done a lot for me, but I hate him, and I can't help it.

I spend weekends with my dad, but whenever I spend them with my mom, she always invites him, and then it always becomes about what he wants to do. They also used to talk badly about my dad, who I know wasn't the best husband, but he was still my dad, and at that time I was a kid, which didn't help things. We disagree on most things, especially politically, which I know is stupid but still. 

My mom is always really upset that I don't get along with him, and says she wishes I loved her enough to like him. I say that just because I don't like him doesn't mean I don't like how he's good for her. But I can't bring myself to like him at all, or appreciate him. Especially now that they're planning on moving in together once I graduate. I just know that I won't want to visit her when I'm in college, because he will always be around. We recently had another arguement about me being disrespectful, which I will admit, I can be very rude (ex: ignoring him purposely when he says hi/bye, having bad tone, talking back).

I don't feel bad about not liking him, because there's really nothing that will ever change that, but I do feel bad that it distresses my mom so much. So, aita?"
564,1jr3q7h,Not the A-hole,AITA for snitching on my girlfriend's friend?,"I (22F) got dragged into my gf's, Eve, (22F) friend group. We met in first year of uni and started dating shortly after. We've been taking classes together since and were part of a larger group. Over time, the group split into smaller circles. For a few semesters, I had to take classes on my own, but I’ve lined up my schedule with Eve's again. Since she never talks about her uni friends, I assumed it would just be the two of us. Turns out she also agreed to take classes with five people from the old group, people I didn't stay in touch with. I don't really vibe with any of them but I keep things civil. I help with papers, buy lunch, run errands, etc. But I still see them as her friends, not mine.

There's one girl I don't like, Paige. She's rude and always tries to push her share of work onto other people. Eve's a reliable person, which means she ends up picking up the slack, and as her partner, I help out so she doesn't get overwhelmed. We have several classes together; this happens a lot and it gets frustrating. Eve refuses to speak up to keep the peace.

Paige isn't just a pain when it comes to academics, her personal life is a mess too. Most of what I know comes from the little things Eve tells me, usually chaotic stories that make me grateful I don't have to deal with her outside of class.

Apparently, Paige has a bf/sugar daddy in his 30s, but is also seeing a guy from the performing arts department. She heard that my friend, Sarah, has been flirting with her man. She drags Sarah's name in the gc and calls her all sorts of names—slut, bitch, whore—accusing her of trying to steal her man. The rest of the group piles on, saying things like, ""Sounds like something she'd do,"" and ""Sarah's group is bad news."" I was a spectator during this, while Eve joined in to support Paige.

Sarah and I are good friends. She's one of the few I keep in touch with and as someone who knows her well, this story didn't add up. Sarah is a feminist and a girl's girl. She'd never do something like that.

Here's where I might be the asshole.

I immediately go to Sarah and ask her about the validity of the story. Of course, it's not true. She tells me they're just friends, and in fact, it was him who came up to her first. She only talks to him because they're in the same circle.

I take a nap and wake up to a bunch of messages from Sarah, telling me that she texted Paige and cleared things up. I then see more messages from Paige calling me all sorts of things. She's furious that I snitched on her and that the gc was supposed to be her safe space. I responded after a few hours and apologized for how I handled the situation. I told her I didn't mean to betray her trust, but I felt it was important to get the truth out there. She was still mad and resorted to name calling for snitching on her.

Eve is not happy. She's been cold towards me since and refuses to talk about it. I can tell she's upset, but she doesn't want to address it."
565,1jr38gh,Asshole,WIBTA  if I tell more people about my engagement?,"Throw away 

Me 22 female have been dating/ living with my partner 22 male for the past four years. We have a great life together and I couldn't be happier! We both come from blended families and have a lot of parental figures in our life. Each of them have had past experiences with love and of course divorce....

Due to multiple factors me and my partner have ""aggreged"" on a secret engagement. Only three close friends know that we are ""engaged"" I put it in quotations as my partner insists he ask me ""properly"" once the family knows.  

While I am thrilled that I can wear my beautiful ring inside the house and Infront of the friends that know I would really like to wear it all the time. Try as I might I can't convince my partner to let me. 

I want to respect his wishes but, I also really want to tell more people about our engagement. I don't think it's a big deal if our families knew.

For some context. Our families have met and got along pretty well.  I love his family and I believe they love me. I know my family loves him and he loves them back. I see no reason to keep our engagement a secret but he insists his family will give him crap if he tells them. 

  
I know his bio parents were engaged and married at a young age so maybe he is scared they will be disappointed. I just don't know. 

All I know is that I want a proper engagement and I personally believe we are ready, I really do not care about other peoples opinions. It is not like we plan to be married in a year. 

I'm not going to do anything that could damage my relationship with my man as I very much love him. 

I guess I just want some outside perspective. Thank you for reading my ramble :)

566,1jr383l,Not the A-hole,AITA for not being sad about my dad,"Still not entirely sure if this is the right sub for this, but I've been doing a lot of thinking recently and can't shake this thought. 

Recently my dad was admitted to the hospital, still not entirely sure as to all the details, but the way my mom described it is that he'll either need a new kidney, or he'll have to be on dialysis for the rest of his life. In his current state, there's a real chance that he won't recover, and I'm not really sad about it. Putting that into text makes me feel like a pretty shitty person.

My dad has never had a good relationship with me or my brother. Throughout my entire life I never really felt like I had a father, if that makes any sense, I never felt comfortable talking to him about my problems or anything like that. I just feel like a terrible son and person in general for not being sad."
567,1jr366o,Not the A-hole,AITA for not understanding my girlfriend,"Am I the asshole for not understanding?

Okay, to sum it down: my partner (F17) and I (M18) have had a terrible day, so let me get straight to it. Yesterday night, me and her had a stupid disagreement related to a movie, which is okay—whatever, I don’t mind—because she was so mature about it in the end that I completely forgot about it.

But then she was worried that I was going to get fed up with her from her constantly being upset and not thinking about what she’s saying, and how her pettiness is going to drive me away. I told her and reassured her that it isn’t.

Then, when we agreed that it was late and we should sleep, I saw she had texted me in the middle of the night saying something about how she saw some reels that I had saved, which were just genuine relationship advice on what kills relationships and what to try to avoid doing. She thought I saved them because she was like that, which I assured her she wasn’t. Okay, and we were good—or so I thought.

We had agreed to call at 6:30 PM because we were busy, and around 5 PM my parents gave me notice that we had to go meet some family friends we hadn’t seen in 5 years. I told her, “Hey, is it okay if we call at 5:30, as my parents just told me this?”

And then it’s like a switch flipped—she immediately became unreasonable and upset. Throughout the day, she basically told me she didn’t want to talk to me and for me to leave her alone, saying things like, “I don’t want anything from you atp,” and blaming me for not being there for her when she needs me, just basically taking it out on me.

So AITA for thinking she’s being inconsiderate and unreasonable?

I tried explaining to him the glass is not tempered or made for hot water. This made him even more mad that he told me to stop. I tried showing him a google search but he wouldn’t listen.  Now I’m frustrated and angry because I thought it was common sense and my reaction was cause for concern. To him I overreacted.

570,1jr2rtv,Not the A-hole,AITAH for suggesting my girlfriend see a psychologist?,"I (22M) have gently suggested a couple times that my girlfriend (22F) might benefit from seeing a psychologist. She’s been dealing with a lot—mostly unresolved issues with her parents and a deep sense of inadequacy. She often expresses feeling unintelligent, incompetent, and like she’s not worthy of much. For example, she didn’t want to attend her own graduation celebration because she said her degree “isn’t worth much compared to yours” (I’m in bioengineering, she’s in a different field).

I care about her deeply and want to support her, but it’s becoming emotionally heavy for me. I often feel like I’m her only outlet, and while I try to listen and be there, I also know I’m not a therapist. The problem is, therapy is stigmatized in her family, so she’s hesitant to even consider it. She hasn’t been hostile about my suggestion, but I do worry she takes it as me saying she’s broken or something, which isn’t how I mean it at all. She also reacted A LOT when I even slightly suggested the fact rhat perhaps I wasn't the only one of her entourage to notice it, ex. her parents, friends, etc. She told me that she tells her friends all about it, but all in a jokely manner, and that they ""get it"".

I just want her to feel better and get the help I truly believe she deserves. But at the same time, I’m also starting to feel burned out from being the only one she leans on emotionally.

571,1jr1tjl,Asshole,AITA for dirtying up my school bathroom?,"I (17M) go to a highschool in NJ, and during my 6th period class (AP Physics C) which is a double period, I went to go use the bathroom. Out of the 10 period days in my school, the ones in the middle tend to be the most popular periods for students to have a free period, or lunch.

Luckily for me, I decided to take Physics C, which gets rid of my free period lol. With this, a lot of kids go to the bathroom to vape, and just hangout.

I am a shy bathroom user so I usually go to the stall so the students who loiter don't disrupt my stream. I'm not going to go deeply into this, but usually my pee streams aren't fully straight so its already pretty hard to aim (Sorry for the weirdness I just wanted to put some details). With this, the kids decided to mess around with the other stalls with people, and eventually it was me, who was mid stream.

They decided to bang on my door, and I flinched making the stream hit the toilet paper, which is just way to close to the toilet in my opinon. At that moment, I got so mad at them that I just said, ‘Screw it,’ and started streaming everywhere on purpose, hoping to try to get them in trouble and blaming it on them later.

This sadly backfired really bad as they immediately realized that I started doing it on purpose. Next period I get sent to the dean and now I have lunch detention for a week.

My whole life she has used me and my sister as her slaves while she drank, did drugs and cheated on my father. My sister is 5 years older than me and got out when she was 15. I on the other hand lived by her rules got a job babysitting at 12 because I was very mature for my age. I grew up taking care of my dad when he got really sick(cancer) I was 11. Any way fast forward many years we moved to VA and I found an amazing man we were friends for years then got married. My mom lives with us for awhile but I had to make her leave because she almost got us evicted because of her being a slob and letting her dogs destroy her room ewww poo everywhere. 
 Anyway now she says I abandoned her (side note she lives 14 minutes from us she lives with my aunt) I do visit her and take her grocery shopping etc, I make sure she has her meds, get her baths for her etc. I bring her to the house to see the kids and hangout. But she says that I am a b**** because I won't let her stay the night anymore ( my kids don't like her she attacked my oldest son, she calls me fat and makes me wait on her hand and foot) I promised my dad when he was dying that I would take care of her but he knew what kind of person she was so I took care of her as long as I could.

For context, I am living in a college housing complex where I have several other roommates and we share multiple bathrooms. I have been sharing a bathroom with a roommate that, against university policy, has been housing an additional person in her unit. We hadn’t directly discussed taking turns buying toilet paper, hand soap, cleaning supplies, etc.. but there was an agreement that we would take turns since we share the bathroom. We also didn’t directly agree not to use each other’s personal hygiene products, but that was a given since sharing a space with a stranger is already awkward enough. Another important detail is that we always cleaned up after ourselves, or at least I did, since it is a shared space. For example, if I had trash I would throw it out in a separate container and I would never throw it in her trash. 

We had no problems with this all year up until now. After coming back from spring break, I noticed my body wash had been completely used up and filled with water. I also started to notice it became a trend that they were opening my personal drawer and using my perfume, soap, etc. To not make false accusations, I simply wrote a note asking them not to do that and left it in the drawer… (the only way they would see that would be if they opened it). They have continued to use my stuff. 

Today, I received a text from her saying, “hey, can you take the trash out. i’ve been waiting as i’ve been taking it out this whole year. and i was waiting for you to put a bag or something bc i ran out and you j started putting stuff in it so please take it out and start helping me with our bathroom”. which I thought was a bit rude to say since I have NEVER thrown trash in there. However, I understand it is our bathroom and I simply responded saying I would do it but it was not my trash. Although I thought it was a bit rude, I shook it off and went back to my apartment to do it when I heard her and her partner talking about how I ‘was a year older and that I needed to grow up’. I feel that this is a bit rude since I have been nothing but nice to her and besides that it was NOT my trash! 

Since this, I noticed that we ran out of soap and they have been filling it with water. To clarify, I was the last one that bought hand soap. So I took my soap dispenser and hid it in my room. After thinking over the situation, I thought it was a bit unfair for me to buy soap again considering I have to pick up the slack for two people now. I also thought it was unfair for her to imply that I don’t help at all as if she is not using my products!? 

I talked this over with my friend and she suggested I should report them for housing an additional person. AITA if I report them? "
574,1jr11iw,Not the A-hole,"AITA for feeding the animals extra and ""untraining"" them?","Hello. I(20F) am not an animal person: I don't hate them and do like playing with them, but I'm not really responsible enough to have one and don't intend to have one. 

My brother(32M) really loves animals. He has a ""habit"", I guess you can call it that, where he will impulsively bring an animal home, which I guess is how we ended up with five dogs and three cats. However, most of the time he's either in his room working from home or in his girlfriend's house, so essentially the main caretaker for the animals is dad(65M). 

My brother did tell us about the rules for the animals. The most important are: ""they only eat twice a day and if they don't start eating in five minutes you have to take the food away"" and ""they can't go inside, only in the yard"". 

However, last month I was returning home from work and I heard the new puppy crying. He is like three months old I think and he was looking at his food bowl. I put food for him and since the others were around I put it for them as well. Essentially it kept happening until it became habit for me to put food for them when I got home from work, and somehow this led to them being allowed in my room, and now the dogs sleep at the foot of my bed and the cats in my bookshelf every night. 

My brother is very mad at me and everytime he notices he goes in my room to make them leave, and we are fighting because of it. I understand the animals are his and stuff, but the animals clearly like to sleep in my room and I don't mind them there. My room is separate from the rest of the house so it's not like it bothers the other occupants. I think he is the most mad about the feeding since he claims I will make them fat. He is making it clear that I am untraining them by breaking the rules. 

My dad doesn't care and says my brother doesn't get an opinion because he isn't the one that buys food and cleans the poop for all the animals he brings home. My brother claims they are still theirs to decide what to do with. AITA? "
575,1jqzt4o,Asshole,AITA for convincing my dad not to get start a company with his son in law?,"So for reference we all live in Toronto and immigrated from a 3rd world country after my parents were successful in starting a company.

My sister married a man from a village who doesn’t have many skills, and in our country it is traditional to have the man pay for a house. But since his family was really poor, our family paid for everything including a jeep, a 2 million dollar house in Oakville and basically everything else. But oh well, bc my sister likes him.

He’s actually pretty hard working and he definitely loves my sister (he took out debt and gifted her a BMW when he barely knew her) and has pretty good people skills.

But anyways, he asked for large warehouse that he would run in Canada while my parents made the product back home. But I felt that it’s very unfair when they literally gave him everything and it was all handed to him, when he has not proven that he is a good business person (PS he dropped out of an extremely prestigious business school in our country) 

Anyways I’ll be honest, I felt a bit jealous, and i told my dad not to buy him the warehouse bc in accounting class we learned that if you want to start a business the percentage you contribute should determine the profit you get back. 

I feel this is fair, but I also think that my jealousy was maybe a bit much, he is an honest person, very hard working and continues to work minimum wage even though he could just sit at home, but I just felt jealous bc he just married into our family. 

But he has no other skills and he has very well raised kids and I feel bad that they basically have no way to get richer, and they wouldn’t have such a nice life if it wasn’t for my parents.

Like I have some friends who having hard working parents who can barley afford to RENT in Toronto. 

But I feel like this is the same thing for me bc I was just handed this life (to take over the company) bc i was born into this family. And I think my jealousy was very obvious when I was talking about him. Honestly that feels pretty bad too, to know my parents think I am jealous my sister and brother in law. 

However, I told them to leave more of the inheritance to my sister bc she’s also doesnt have any college degree or trade skills and is a stay at home mom (so she has no income), and her kids are very cute and deserve a good life. But adding onto that  I said it was bc with my business major I could make more money with the company (gosh I sound so bad right now)

Anyways, I don’t know how I should approach this bc it’s really uncomfortable, obviously parents want to see the best in their kids, but it irks me to know that I came across as jealous and greedy… 

Anyways AITA?"
576,1jqzkri,Not enough info,AITA for laughing at my friend’s karaoke singing?,"I NB/21 (college study) was pregaming with some friends, one of which was completely sober. A few shots in, one my friends, let's call him James, was drunk and decided to show a video of him singing because he thought he was good at singing. To avoid being rude and because I thought that's where the topic of his singing would come to an end, I told him he sounded pretty good. However, our one sober friend (Kendall) encouraged him to sing ""We Don't Talk Anymore"" by Charlie Puth. Keeping in mind that I was drunk and James is tone-deaf, I had a very difficult time not laughing. For context, two other friends, Carlos and Logan, left the room because they could not handle the second-hand-embarrassment. I was in the room with another friend, Gustavo (who also was drunk/tipsy), and we decided to stay to not make him feel bad. In retrospect, I feel pretty bad for laughing, but how much of an asshole am I?"
577,1jqzgal,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling my friend that my our friends were going to the mall.,"Okay so I have this friend we met in the sixth grade and now have gotten really close these past years. 

Yesterday one of my friends we’ll call him Josh. He texted me while I was taking a nap, I wasn’t really asleep yet so I decided to answer. He asked me if I could go to the mall today and I said I couldn’t because I didn’t have nobody to pick me up or drop me off. So he said it was okay and that it was last minute so it was alright. I then asked him if our two other friends were going, we’ll call them Rose and Chloe. He told me that he was asking Rose right now (it was confirmed Chloe was going) I said okay so after that I went back to sleep.

Fast forward to when I woke up a couple hours later Rose texted me and asked me if I had seen Chloe and Josh’s stories on Instagram I said no. So I went to go check and it was just a bunch of pictures of them at the mall together so in my head I was like okay I knew they were going so I didn’t think anything of it. Rose then was getting mad at how they didn’t invite us and she was just going off on them, I was confused because I had thought Josh had asked so I said “didn’t they ask you?”. She then started going off on Josh. I guess then she realized that I knew and I was invited so then she said “Oh u knew”. I already knew she was mad because I could tell by the way she was texting, so I started apologizing and explaining how I took a nap and didn’t think to tell her because I thought Josh had asked her. Couple minutes after that Chloe texted in our group chat with me, Rose, and Josh, she just started apologizing about the plans and how they were last minute. But the thing that stood out to me was that Chloe said that she had texted Rose about the plans and Josh also had texted her to pull up, the thing is that Rose left them both on seen and didn’t say anything so I didn’t know why she was going off on them and saying she didn’t get invited. I then went to go check Rose and I’s messages and I sent another apology, she hadn’t responded. I then was left on delivered for an hour. I just don’t understand if she has a right to be mad or not. With her leaving me on delivered for an hour she made me worry and I felt really bad about the whole thing. Another thing Josh had texted me about it and I decided to tell him how I was worried and concerned about how she was mad at me (I wasn’t  talking shit I was just venting). Josh then plainly texted Rose “What’s wrong Rose”, he then told me that she responded and had an attitude with him and was just going off. So let me know because im just really worried about it."
578,1jqyz1u,No A-holes here,AITA since I told my gf she's freaking out over nothing?," My gf has had body issues the whole 5 years we have been together. I love her and remind her how beautiful she is constantly. She has dealt with an eating disorder before me, and I cook for her to make sure she eats stuff other than energy drinks, chips, and sugar.

 As of late, she has been having trouble with acne. She might have like 2 pimples and think the world is over. I had tons of acne in high school, got made fun of, and got over it. She has been dealing with it due to the birth control pills she takes. I have told her multiple times that if she hates it, we can go back to condoms or switch pills. She just doesn't due to fear of other pills' side effects and/or ""not wanting to waste the pills cause they'll throw them away""?

 Today, she went to get this cream that's been helping her with the acne, and apparently, the company stopped making the cream. She's crying on the phone ,driving, talking to me about how she's having a panic attack, and wanting to scream and cry in the store after noticing it is not being made anymore. I first told her to pull over and not to drive if she's panicking like this. Then, I told her a realistic plan of trying other products that I could even buy for her so she could test them. I also told her about this beef tallow thing that she showed me a while back.

 She wasn't happy and told me how she ""fucking hates her skin and wanted to scream as hard as she can in the store"". I told her how she has to find a way to calm down and that something like acne cream shouldn't throw her into a huge melt down by seeing 1 of 999999999999 different creams is gone. She yelled at me and hung up.

 I can understand how much she hates having acne, but trying other creams and potentially finding a better one sounds so easy to me. She will maybe have 4 pimples for a few weeks and won't explode. Am I The Asshole for saying  she shouldn't freak out over it?"
579,1jqyckq,Not the A-hole,AITA for interrupting my mom’s phone call because I thought she was being scammed?,"I (42m) am visiting my mom (69f) and staying with her for a short time. Today, while she was watching my nephew (6m), I walked into her room to get ready to take him home.

When I entered, she was visibly upset, freaking out, and on a speakerphone call. The person on the other end mentioned something like ""account,"" ""bank information,"" or ""PIN"" (I don’t recall exactly), and she started reading numbers aloud.

I work in IT security, and since she and my nephew had been having a nice time earlier, her distress seemed sudden and unexplained. Worried she might be falling for a financial scam, I rushed over and asked, “Is everything okay?” I gently asked her to pause for a second, explaining I was concerned she might be disclosing sensitive info to a scammer. I requested to see the phone—she was hurriedly entering information—but once I saw it was her bank’s app, I immediately handed it back. My interruption didn’t delay her from finishing what she was doing.

I had about 5 seconds to assess the situation, and I genuinely believed she could be in danger. I wouldn’t have interfered otherwise.

After dropping off my nephew and returning to her home, she told me I was out of line, that I’d violated her privacy, and needed to be more considerate. I reiterated that I only acted because I thought she was at risk. She repeatedly said, “I’m not dumb enough to enter bank account information \[for a scammer\]” and “You think I’m stupid.” I explained that even smart people get tricked, and I’d acted because she was upset + entering numbers after a question about her bank.

I understand why she’d find my interruption annoying, but I don’t think it was inconsiderate—I was trying to protect her. AITA?"
580,1jqxz4d,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my husband he needs to clean the toilets?,"I (40f) am a SAHM, though I work part-time from home. My husband (43M) works from home. We have a great relationship, but I admit I do get frustrated that he doesn't help more around the house and with the kids (8, 6, 4).

My husband can't aim to save his life. This is a long-standing issue and when we first starting living together (and I worked full-time) cleaning the bathroom was his chore because it drives me crazy. However, bathroom duty fell to me after we had kids. This is fine, but over the last 4 months he's been on a new medicine for his diabetes - the perineum infection side-effect one. Turns out, the reason it can cause perineum infections is it makes you urinate sugar. 

It is so gross. Like, the texture of dried milk in a cereal bowl. I have to SCRUB to get it off. And he can't aim so it's not just the toilet, but the walls, the floor, and the cabinet. So now a task that used to take 30 minutes twice a week takes an hour to an hour three times a week (because sugar molds quickly). 

I've put cleaning wipes in every bathroom and asked him to do a quick wipe down each time he goes, but he would forget frequently and I didn't notice a discernable difference. I asked him to a quick wipe down of the 2 main bathrooms each night to try to mitigate the mess. But he was always too tired or forgot. Today, I told him he needs to take over cleaning the 2 bathrooms he uses the most (just the toilets and surrounding area). I made a point to be calm about it, but explained that cleaning the bathroom makes me resent him because the changes in his medication and his inability to regularly clean up after himself have made the chore extremely onerous for me and he has been unable to complete the tasks that would ease the burden on me. 

He's angry, claiming that I'm holding things he can't control (the change in meds, his struggles aiming,  his ADHD making him forget to wipe things down) against him and that I'm trying to get out of a chore I dislike. I mean, I can't say I LIKE cleaning toilets, but it really wasn't an issue until his meds changed. The new med works great, so I don't want him to get off of it. However, since the majority of my time cleaning the bathroom is cleaning HIS mess, I feel like this responsibility should fall to him. AITA?

TLDR: Husband's diabetes meds changed, so now he urinates sugar. He can't aim, so it makes a giant mess and I think he should clean it up. "
581,1jqwvep,Not the A-hole,AITA for Calling Out My Landlord in a Group Chat?,"So, I (27M) live in a small apartment complex with about ten other tenants. We all have a group chat for things like maintenance issues, package mix-ups, and general building updates. Our landlord, Mark (mid-50s), is also in the chat, but he rarely responds unless it’s about rent.

The problem? He sucks at fixing things.

For the past six months, we’ve had ongoing issues—leaky ceilings, broken washers, heating problems, you name it. Every time someone reports something, Mark either ignores it or promises to “send someone” and then nothing happens. Meanwhile, he has no problem reminding us about rent two weeks in advance.

Last month, my sink started leaking badly. I reported it to him privately—no response. A week later, I messaged again—he left me on read. Finally, I brought it up in the group chat, thinking maybe if other tenants chimed in, he’d take it seriously. Turns out, almost everyone had unresolved issues too. A few people started piling on, asking why their problems hadn’t been addressed either.

That’s when Mark finally responded—not to apologize or fix anything, but to call me out for “making him look bad” in front of the other tenants. He said if I had an issue, I should’ve kept it between us and not turned the chat into a “complaint session.” I told him I did message him privately, multiple times, and got ignored. Then I asked if he planned to actually fix anything.

Now, he’s claiming I “disrespected” him and is threatening to kick me out when my lease is up. Some of the other tenants think I went too far, while others thanked me for speaking up.

AITA for putting him on blast in the group chat?"
582,1jqwu23,Not the A-hole,AITA for copying my friends business?,"Hi everyone! I’ve decided to ask here as I know Reddit is brutally honest and I’m feeling a bit guilty about this situation.

My close friend recently started her own cleaning business and I had been doing a few fortnightly cleans for her while I’m on maternity leave. My maternity leave is now nearing an end and I’m dreading going back to work. I thought opening my own cleaning business would be ideal as it’s flexible! I would love to continue cleaning for my friends business however it is not by the books and I am only being paid £10 an hour (out of the £16 which the customers pay for their clean), which barely covers my travel expenses and supplies . It started off fine as it was helping me get out the house and her build clients for her business but now I’m feeling a little used. I’m scared to say to her I’m thinking of starting my own business as I’m afraid it would affect our friendship so thinking of just going ahead and keeping my page as anonymous as possible… am I an asshole for just going ahead behind her back?

My dad fully cut all ties and disowned my sister, simply because she started dating interracially... He expected her to be all broken up and distraught about it, but got thrown off when I happily opened my home to her.

AITA for telling him that if he cuts ties with her, he cuts ties with me? I feel like im being a good brother, but because of the way i was raised there is this little voice telling me im still an asshole for saying that to the man that raised me...

And just so we are clear, there is literally no additional context. Its ONLY because of the interracial thing. "
584,1jqvs27,Not enough info,AITA for making mean comments to my friends after they tried to sneak onto our holiday?,"Half of our group (Group A) decided to go on a holiday and the other half (Group B) decided they did not want to go. So Group A went away and decided to book this holiday to tenerife. The day after the booking was confirmed and payed we found out one person from Group A went and added Group B to our holiday behind our back and did not invite our other friend from our friend group that decided they wanted to go aswell. Group B also are paying a significant amount less and screwing up our room situation. Where previously we were in rooms of two, we are now being forced into the same rooms as before but with an extra person each, bringing sofa beds into the equation. They decided to try and hide their addition to the booking for as long as possible. Obviously when the secret was revealed, our group (Group A) was mad and in the heat of the moment we may have responded with some attitude and aggression, including making comme ts about their itteligence, mental capacity, and ability to understand a situation. Group B are not owning up to a single thing they did wrong and keep adding lies to their excuses. I was the bigger person and tried to make an apology to which Group B scrolled on there phones and ignored what I said. This made me very upset and I believe they are acting like children. However, they believe that I am the one in the wrong. Anyway what do you guys think?"
585,1jqvb9h,Not the A-hole,AITA for going off on my mom because she keeps yelling at my dog.,"My mom was over visiting today. I have two dogs. A little dog and a medium sized dog. Anyways my mom was trying to talk to my sister. My dog was playing with her squeak toy. I guess my dog was making too much noise squeaking her toy because my mom got up and screamed at my dog. This isn't the first time she has yelled at my dog. She has yelled at my dog for pawing at her because she wants attention. Knowing that my mom doesn't like this I have cracked down on my dog pawing at her. I personally don't like it either, and it's just rude in general. However, today I felt she crossed the line because my dog was simply playing with her toy. 

Anyway, I went off on her. I was like so she can't even be a dog now? My mom was like I can't hear your sister. I said go outside and talk if it bothers you too much. My mom has been dealing with arthritis in both of her knees, and I try to be sympathetic. I get her groceries, and run errands for her. However, she can be a jerk, and touchy when her legs are bothering her. She will get irritated and unpleasant to be around. After she screams at you, or is short with you. She will say ""oh I'm sorry for yelling, or being short, my legs are bothering me"". I understand that she's in pain, but that shouldn't give her the license to be a jerk to everyone. I also deal with pain as I work a physical job. I have tendinitis in both of my achilles. Sometimes I can barely walk in the morning, it hurts that bad. My body is constantly sore as well. However, I'm still able to respect others. 

Anyway my mom brought the same excuse today that her legs were bothering her. I told her that I understand she is in pain, but that doesn't give her the excuse to be a jerk. She proceeded to blow up at me. I kicked her out of my house. I told her just I need some time away. I do feel bad for going off on her, and I feel bad that she's in pain, but the way she acts makes it very difficult to be around her. You have to walk on egg shells."

I said it was sad that she couldn't go but that I still wanted to go with my friends. She got mad at me and said that this band is our thing and that its disrespectful to go to the concert without her, that she feels like im always sharing the couple things with other people.

Earlier on today me and some friends wanted to play some games in the living room, so i took my TV down ( roughly worth £100) and my xbox , and i left them on the stand, one of my housemates tried to plug in the HDMI cable and somehow knocked the TV off of the stand, completely obliterating the screen. 

And just for a bit of back story, last year me and my housemate bought the exact same tv from the exact same shop. 

Initially he said i could have his TV  in replacement so i moved the TV in to the living room, and after we played our games i moved the TV back into my room. 

Now he’s messaging me asking for it back and saying he will replace mine in 3 weeks time. And i told him that i wasn’t gonna wait 3 weeks for a replacement, for a TV he broke, when he’s got the exact same model as me. AITA?

588,1jqujph,Not the A-hole,AITA for using a cup from the kitchen and/or for freaking out on my roommate who has OCD?,"My roommate and I have lived together for 3 years and I’ve learned a lot about how the disorder works for her and what her do’s and dont’s are. She has the HSV virus (she has oral coldsores about once or twice a year) and so things that touch her mouth are “contaminated” in her eyes and need to be kept separate from everything else. That means the kitchen and her bathroom sink are contaminated and anything from those areas are not allowed anywhere else. If there happens to be a “breach” then she can either obsess about it for hours and scrub whatever surface or item that was messed up or she trusts me to wipe it with a Lysol wipe and it’s clean after that. 

Today, while she was gone at work, I refilled our cat’s automatic feeder and was going to use a disposable cup from the kitchen to do so. I realized it’d be faster to pour from the bag so didn’t use the cup and simply placed it on top of the wet food cans we have. My mistake is that I didn’t dispose of the cup before she got home so she sees it with the cat stuff and freaks out on me. I normally know how to de-escalate by wiping them off with Lysol wipes, but even after I did so, she brought up my room (where I don’t follow her rules and will bring a cup of water from the kitchen and leave on my desk) and called me and my room contaminated, that I was no help and that I don’t respect her. She also said she has to deep clean all of the automatic feeders and throw away all the cat food and the wet food cans. I lashed back out to her telling her that she doesn’t have an active cold sore, cats can’t get cold sores, it’s real in her mind but nothing is actually wrong or contaminated, and that she needs to seek therapy because this is insane and stupid. 

I understand that she can’t help it but it gets to a point every now and again that her getting pissed off at me for things normal people do that won’t harm anyone and is only an issue because of her disorder is too much. Also, I’m pissed that she says I’m no help. I fill her water bottle almost daily. If she fills it and there’s a drop of water on the outside, I Lysol it. I’ve even had to wipe off 32 cans of cat food when my brother helped us with groceries not knowing the rules and placed them on the kitchen counter. I’m tired of having to tip toe and then getting berated for things that genuinely have no effect on anything besides the anxiety in her brain. 

AITA for using a cup from the kitchen and/or for freaking out on her? "
589,1jqugfo,Asshole,AITA for not picking up my drunk sister from a house party?,"My sister is 16f and I’m 24m.

Last night, around 3am, I get a call from my sister and she says that she snuck out of the house and she’s really drunk and at a party with a bunch of older people and she needs me to come pick her up and she gave me the address (which was about 45 minutes away).

I was planning on watching C-Span at 4 AM (we live in the West Coast), and calling in to talk about issues, since that is kind of a tradition of mine. Because of this I decided I did not want to go pick her up.

I called my parents and told them where she was and she needed them to come get her. I didn’t think about it again.

On my break this morning I get a call from my parents saying that my sister is grounded and had her phone taken away from her. They thanked me for calling them.

I’ve gotten other opinions that have kind of made it seem as though I was the asshole but I think I did the right thing.

591,1jqtx4o,Asshole,WIBTA if I faked being sick to get out of a rugby tournament where they'll likely use me as a benchwarmer,"I am a college rugby player, and I have been playing since January of 2022. I only ever took one season off in the fall of 2023 (when I was on a semester abroad). However, they've more or less put me on the back burner because a guy who has been doing football since he was 12 is kinda their star.

Admittedly, I'm not the best. And outside of some lacrosse in middle school, I haven't really done too many combat-related sports. But I have been on the team my whole career. Additionally, I was one of the few guys who actually went to tournaments and didn't quit for half the season following an injury. \[Edit: last semester / Fall 2024\]

I did politely ask one of the coaches (the one that wants to go pro) that I feel that my experience has earned me more than just a back-up position. He was professional about telling me that 'it is what it is' and that I just can't compete with this 'since the age of 12' guy.

It's worth mentioning that, to my memory, he didn't say anything about 'we'll do what we can' or 'I'll try to fit you in'. Simply 'You're not more-than-30-seconds material'. (Not those exact words, but those were the vibes.)

\[Edit\]  
I was finally starting to get some field time last spring. But then the new guy came in and I am beginning to feel like Woody in the first Toy Story.

One of the only reasons I would want to do this is that we haven't done social in forever (because there haven't been enough involved people to decide who can be the designated driver). Otherwise, I'd be sacrificing the entire weekend for, at most, a minute of field time. That would likely be if someone got injured.

Would I be the asshole if I decided to fake being sick to get out of this tomorrow?

I can see the perspective of me being a bad teammate by skipping an important tournament in the off-chance they need a backup guy. Admittedly, I am a little afraid it's gonna be a little more fun than just standing around and then going to a party with guys who almost never text me back.

I also respect my time enough that I'm not willing to do a long car ride on Friday, a tournament on Saturday, and a long drive on Sunday to be on the field for less than 2 minutes across 3 28-minute games. Not to mention I'm most likely never gonna go pro. So this isn't exactly gonna be my 'Disney Channel Original Movie' moment. On top of that, I could be wasting valuable study time for an exam worth 20 percent of my grade a week from Tuesday.

What's your take, Reddit?

\[Slight edit:\]  
It's worth mentioning that I would go to literally any other tournament that would be a day trip away. And have done so, gladly. I just don't know if I'm willing to do a time commitment of essentially 48 hours for less than 6 minutes of field time.

[Update: 4/04/2025]

Decided to not fake being sick. A few other guys apparently backed out at the last minute, too. 

I hope to have more than 30 seconds. If not, I might just do one more tournament and then call it a 'career'.

I appreciate the folks telling me to be honest and a team player and not fake it.

Currently on the way. Thank you, Reddit. For being my three ghosts."
592,1jqt090,Not the A-hole,AITA If I (29F) Tell My Husband (31M) I'm not Willing to Spend $10k on a Down Payment for a New Truck Because Driving My Car Makes Him Feel 'Less of a Man'?,"Edit to clarify title- we are looking at USED trucks. Said new as the truck would be new to us. Doesn’t change point of post much but wanted to be accurate.

Backstory - my husband and I got married last July but we've been together for a total of 7.5 years. We've always kept our finances separate but I've been wanting to merge accounts for a while to remove that feeling of ""his and my"" money and approach our finances as a team rather than two individuals. If it matters, he makes about $15-20k more a year than I do, but I have the most money in my savings account.

Long story short, his car has a lot of problems and he's been wanting a truck for a while. Logically, we really do need a truck to allow us to do more home renovations and be less reliant on family, but I'm not sure now is the right time.

I've asked him if we can set a goal to purchase a truck this summer so we can focus on saving up for a good down payment to lower our monthly payments and so we can remain secure with a ""nest egg"" in our bank account. I currently have $13k in my account - this includes both my savings and my checking account. He has anywhere from $5k-7k in his account typically. While I've kept my spending more frugal, he has, to be fair, spent more money on our home and daily needs as I work remote whereas he works in person so it's easier for him to grab last minute items throughout the week.

I want to make sure I am not making him look like he's being selfish, that's not the case, but I do think he is being immature. He asked me if we can go look at a $39k truck this weekend and is asking me to put $10k down. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not hoarding my money from him, but I grew up homeless, without basic needs, and I do not ever want to put myself into a position where I am struggling again. We are 100% not poor but I would feel very insecure dropping my account down by that much when I've been saving this money for YEARS. To add to the conflict, when I remind him we don't *need* the truck this minute and that we can use my car until say August/September, he says driving my car makes him feel like he's not a man.

I tried to tell him that there's nothing manlier than a man who puts his families financial interests before his wants, but he just clams up. He essentially told me that I obviously don't think of my bank account as ours and what I say is apparently the final say.

I've tried to have a mature conversation to weigh the pros and cons but he is legitimately pouting. I'm talking no eye contact, mono-syllable responses, and not engaging in the discussion. I don't want to have him feeling like his wants aren't valid, but how do I get him to see from my perspective? Or if necessary, how do I see from his when he won't give me anything more than ""It's the only truck that meets our requirements within 500 sq miles, you have more money than I do, and your car is a chicks car""?

TLDR - my husband wants me to drop my bank account down to $3k so he can have a manly vehicle.

**Editing to address some questions, feedback, and overall absurdity:**

I'm sure most of you out there understand that there's only so much context or nuance that can be included within a singular Reddit thread. With that in mind, let's try not to judge my husband too harshly. 

First things first, I want to address the elephant in the room which might disappoint some of you: I drive a black 2018 Nissan Sentra… we call her Bernice. Excellent gas mileage, comfortable, spacious enough for a starter family, and still shiny too. He has no problem whatsoever in the way he’s perceived driving the car- it’s the fact that it has no torque to it. His current car is a 2016 Subaru WRX and he’s spent the last 8+ years driving it. I can’t lie, I also **really** enjoy the turbo and the handling, so I understand the disappointment going from that to Bernice. She’s a true point A to point B vehicle, no bells or whistles, and always loses in a race. So while I still don’t think this is a good enough reason to jump the gun on this truck, it’s really not about being in a truck. 

Piggy backing off of this \^ I quoted him verbatim on the title. He truly said “Driving your car makes me feel less of a man” but it isn’t any deeper than the fact that my car is slow and a bad choice of words on his part. But to play the devil's advocate, I do call my car a she and named her Bernice…. So I guess I started the whole gender assignment debacle. He’s not a misogynist and while he wasn’t choosing his words correctly, I don’t think his feelings are invalid to an extent. He was in motocross throughout middle and highschool and as soon as he had enough money, he bought a sports bike. Add in that he’s so used to a quick day-to-day vehicle, I see why he might feel stifled by a boring car like mine. Is that a mature excuse? No, but it’s not hard to understand his inner feelings on this. 

Next, I want to be fair to both myself and to him on our spending and why our bank accounts are where they are right now. He took out a loan for his motorcycle in 2016 for what I think was a $15-16k loan and then took out another loan in 2017 to buy his car. I don’t know the numbers exactly but he put a reasonable down payment on the car and ended up with a $26k loan. Objectively, both were bad financial decisions but he was barely 22/23 so I’ll give him some grace on that. He paid off his bike in 2023 and his car late last year - he sold his bike last summer as well (now that I think about it, losing his bike and having his Subaru start dying might explain the urgency he's feeling). With both of those loans rolling over the last several years and taking on home ownership, he wasn’t saving much. Because we weren’t engaged at the time of us buying the house and I wouldn’t benefit from the equity put into the home, we decided I would furnish the house, pay an equal share towards home renovations, pay for the majority of groceries, cover electricity, and internet, but he would cover the mortgage, heating, and taxes. It was a fair exchange as we did look into the numbers to make sure we were both putting in a fair share based on our individual income. 

Now why, 8+ months without those big monthly payments and the extra money after selling his bike is he still not saving enough? That is the big question. I took the advice many of you gave me and sat down with excel after reading through some of your responses and began a budget for us. I am seeing areas I need to improve in but will have to see what’s going on with his numbers tomorrow.

One more thing, though they were buried, some of you did suggest putting a ball sack on the back end of Bernice. It was a valid suggestion but she’s secure in her identity :)"
593,1jqstgk,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling the sub how to pronounce my name?,"We had a substitute teacher today, and while taking attendance, she asked if she was pronouncing my name correctly. I told her she could pronounce it however she wanted—not to be rude, but because I genuinely don’t know how to say it myself. I have an ethnic name, but no one, not even my family, calls me by it. I was given an alias since I was three years old. Despite that, I was called disrespectful and sent out of class. 🫡

Edit to clarify:

I did tell her my alias. Conversation went like

Sub : ""Name. Is that how you pronounce it?""

Me: ""Yes. You can pronounce it however you want.""

Sub: ""Ok. How do you pronounce it?""

Me: ""I'm not sure. I don't go by that name and no one in my class calls me by it either.""

Sub: ""What?""

Me: ""I go by [Alias]. ""

Sub: ""But what's on the paper is [ N A M E]. ""

silence.. 

Sub: ""You can leave for being disrespectful.""


Edit 2:

I only included the part where she could pronounce it however BECAUSE she was going around, asking anyone with a difficult to pronounce name how to pronounce it. I said it to be accommodating. But I can see how it could come off as otherwise.

594,1jqs9rs,No A-holes here,WIBTA for letting my family borrow our car.,"My sister (married) pulled out the driveway through the lawn and damaged her radiator. Yes it was her fault. Yes she realized it was dumb and messed up. They only have one car at the moment. I just sold my BMW and bought a used Honda civic around the same time for Me and my wife. Anyways me and my wife were gonna go for a week on a trip so we didn’t need the car until we got back. I told my wife they’re gonna borrow our car until their car gets fixed or until we return from our trip. My sister is 8 months pregnant and has a toddler at home. And my brother in law needs to go to work. 
My wife doesn’t want to give them the car even though we’re not gonna be home because she claims they’re not gonna be responsible with it. And because my dad smokes and he might get in the car too but he never smokes in the car. 
I’m saying  she’s being selfish for not letting them use our car while we’re gone. Am I the asshole? I have previously let my sister use my BMW before and it came back without a scratch. In perfect condition. That’s the unbiased story.  

Now my opinions. 
Everyone makes mistakes. She learned from it and although she doesn’t take care of her stuff she never damaged my things. 

It’s just a car. Regular used civic. What is family for if not helping out each other when we make mistakes and yes even dumb ones. As long as they learned their lesson. "
595,1jqs1r1,Not the A-hole,AITA for pointing out to my husband that he failed to call me like he said he would?,"My husband texted me and asked me a week ago if we had ""anything going on next Mon., Tues, Wed.""  I replied no.  When he got home from work, he told me that he was going on a fishing trip in Florida for the next week for three days with his brother and some co-workers.  It actually ended up being 4 days, but he wasn't counting the day he was coming home as a day, even though he won't be home until dinner time. 
We have 2 young children at home, so we actually did have things ""going on,"" but nothing I couldn't handle with just one babysitting help from my mom.
The entire time he was gone, I hardly heard a word from him. He texted our group friend chat that I am on sharing pics, and he called two of the nights to say goodnight to the kids; otherwise, he didn't text or call me.  I was not really bothered by this.  But last night, he specifically told me he would call me before his flight left this morning, which was leaving around 11.  Mind you, I have no idea what airline, flight info, or even what hotel he was at. I never received a call this morning.  I texted a little after 11 and asked if he was on the plane.  No answer because it must've taken off. He just called now  to say he landed. I asked why he never called this morning.  He said sorry, he was sleeping in the Uber and then handling the airport stuff. (He only brought a carry on.)  And that he didn't have time.  My response was that he did have time, but I'm not going to make a thing about it. He then said ""are you mad at me?"" I again said that he did have time to call me, but I'm not going to make a big thing out of it.  (Because he never takes ownership.  He always just says Sorry, my bad. Move on.) Anyway, he said ""this is great to come home to.  Thanks a lot."" And hung up on me. 
I honestly feel like he has no respect for me with the whole way he did this trip. We didn't discuss it beforehand. He gave me no information as to where he was going to be. And I didnt even know his flight info. I know one person out of the 6 that he went with.  I feel like his forgetting to call me is just another thing   to pile on. AITA for pointing out that he didn't bother to call me before he left? We have Life360, so I was able to see where he was the whole time, but  I think that's besides the point. "
596,1jqrvcc,Asshole,AITA did my April fools prank go too far?,"I'm a 24M barista and me and my 2 coworkers decided to play an April fools prank on the other coworkers who were off of work that day. 
One of the baristas who was working that day is known to have a fainting disorder and has once fainted at work, nothing serious but everyone was worried at the time. Since then we all joke about it often. As per her idea I sent a picture to the staff group chat of her laying on the floor and told everyone she fainted again. Everyone in the group chat got that it was a prank instantly and found it funny except for the manager. Note that we are all very friendly with each other and often joke/say things that are completely inappropriate for a workplace but genuinely everyone is good with it, including the store manager who is probably the one saying the most unhinged stuff often.  We already apologized and the lie ended as soon as he called and she picked up yelling ""April fools"", we did not drag it for even a second once he called us asking if she was okay. No one is in trouble from it but I could tell from his voice he is as actually mad about it. He's on holiday and will come back next week and I'd hate that maybe from this the light and friendly work environment we have might suffer a bit from this. Where we the assholes? "
597,1jqrg1m,Not the A-hole,AITA My Friend and I Disagree on How Much Money I Owe Her,"Last weekend, myself and two other people went out for some drinks at a nice cocktail bar. We each had two drinks, all the same thing so our bill would split up evenly. At the end of the night, she offered to pay the check and have all of us Venmo her, which we all agreed to. The next morning, she took out the receipt to calculate what we owed her, and realized that the bar had double-charged us for a few of the drinks, meaning that there were 9 drinks on the tab instead of 6. The bill was $160. She said she must've not realized how much it was when she put her card down. It was obviously a mistake, so I said that maybe she could try to call the bar and see if they would be nice enough to fix the charge. She didn't call them, so then I suggested she call her credit card company, explain what happened, and try to dispute the amount she got over-charged for.

A few days later, I asked her if she had made any progress, and she said that her credit card bill was due and had to pay it. Totally understand. Then I asked her if she had ever filed a disupte claim. She told me she called her credit card company and asked them to remove the charge because ""she was drunk and didn't check the amount before she paid"" to which they obviously replied ""No"". She then asked us to pay her for the $160, meaning that I would owe about $55 instead of around $35 (pre tip). I asked if she could just try to file a dispute and see what happens, especially since you can still file even after you've paid the statement and they would've just credited her on her next billing cycle, but she said that she wasn't going to do that.

I know that the amount isn't that much money, but I'm kind of frustrated with how she handled this and then just expected us to be fine with paying for the mistake. First off, she had two opportunites at the bar to realize the amount was wrong- when she put her card down to pay, and when she calculated the tip. Then, even though calling the restaurant or filing a dispute wasn't guaranteed, she didn't try to get the money back. Who tells their credit card company they were drunk when they bought something? That's what bothered me the most. I know I probably sound pretty cheap, but I feel like I'm just throwing away $20 because she was too lazy to try and fix the problem. AITA for just offering to pay what I originally owed and not the extra money?

Edited to fix my math: the $160 includes the tip she added, which she also calculated based on the extra drinks."
598,1jqqh9u,Not the A-hole,AITA Over washing the dishes,"I (72F) do all the cooking, preparing our main meal 4-5 days a week. My husband (73M) is assigned to wash the dishes. I think the dishes should be washed as often as I  cook; that when I'm ready to start the next meal, all the tools should be clean and available to me and the space should be open so I can stack the dishes that I use as I cook. Sometimes I just go ahead and wash them, simultaneously awash in resentment. When I ask him to do it, he does it, simmering in resentment. (all puns intentional). I'm considering just not preparing a meal until the dishes are clean. Is that being an A? "
599,1jqq9j3,Not the A-hole,AITA for not being more apologetic to my mom,"Some backstory, my stepdad and mom met years ago. My stepdad had two daughters from a previous marriage and my mom had my sister and I(8 at the time). Our families combined and we were good for awhile. Then my mom started beefing with their mom and even once got into physical alteration. They hated one another and my mom said that my stepsisters mom gave them hell because she couldn't accept the fact that we were building a new family with her daughters. Eventually my mom and stepsisters started arguing and they left to move in with their mom and that seemed like it was the end of our family. My mom prohibited us from talking to them and that was that.

Years later my mom and I got into a argument where she ended up being arrested and I moved in with my boyfriend. I decided to reconnect with my stepsisters as I was 19 now and wanted to reconnect. So I went over and hung out with them at their mom's house where we played games and the only words exchanged with their mom was ""hello"", ""how are you?"", and ""goodbye"". I told my stepdad and he seemed fine with it.

Eventually I moved back in with my mom as per her request and a few days ago I told her I planned on hanging with my stepsisters at the mall. She said that's fine. She asked me what I was doing after and I told her I was planning on going to their house to hang out. She then told me it was weird how I would go over to their mom's house knowing the host between the two of them. I admittedly got defensive I told her it's not that weird bc I was going there to hang out with my sisters not their mom. She started yelling about how I was unloyal and didn't know where my priorities in family lies. We argued and then I left to mall and afterwards didn't go to their house out of respect of my mom's boundary.

Shes now making cryptic post on Facebook towards me, telling me everything thinks I'm a entitled unloyal child (I'm 20) and at first told me to leave her house, then told me to come back as I couldn't abandon my blood sisters and she will let me stay two months, now she's telling me again that I have to apologize by the end of the week or leave. As I've told her I understand her pain towards their mom and Im not trying to take minimize it but to come at me months after I visited their house and say I'm disloyal is childish. I've even been accommodating leaving the house when she wants me out and not going to my stepsisters house anymore.

I need perspective AITA, I've apologized for what I can and catered to her feelings but she still saying I'm disloyal and an entitled child."

So, my friend Liz and I regularly smoke weed together. This time, she ordered weed fudge from my dealer, who explicitly told me that she should only take small bites at a time. Liz ignored this advice and ate almost the entire thing herself, leaving just a small piece for me to try.
While I felt nothing unusual from my tiny bite, Liz was utterly out of it. The next day, she was furious with me. Apparently, she had gone to Boots (a pharmacy chain) and used one of their drugs tests, which supposedly showed she was positive for ketamine. 
I spoke to the dealer, and they confirmed that there was absolutely no ketamine in the edibles. Liz is now blaming me for her situation because she ordered from my dealer and because I don’t believe her about the ketamine. She insists that I should trust her test results over the dealer’s word. 

Am I the asshole for not believing Liz's test results and insisting that there was no ketamine involved? She keeps saying that I should trust her test, but I know my dealer's products are carefully made and checked.


First time poster, if it matters I'm autistic and im 30 years old. Also anyone who knows me knows I will only do weed no other drugs my dealer knows this and respect it

Extra information based on questions in the comments. 
1 no I did not see the test Liz took
2 my dealer has all their stuff tested and checked and I'm 100% sure of that.

We were working pretty good for the first day or 2, I did have to keep consistently fixing her slides since a lot of them didn't look how they were supposed to, but it was fine.

After 1 or 2 days of working, I had to miss like 2 days of school, and I was *expecting* her to at least get SOME slides done, and then I would fix them when I returned. Came back to school 2 days later, I sat down in class and asked her if she made any progress. She nods, and goes back to her phone. I'm a bit skeptical, so I open my computer. NOTHING was done. NO new slides. And presentation day was TODAY. I wanted to cry. I didn't say anything, and instead started frantically adding slides and finishing things when it was our turn.

And when it was, the presentation was horrible. She wasnt making eye contact, reading directly off the screen AND was throwing me off too! It was over, the teacher had put in the grade. C+.

You may think that's not bad but when you have a mother with extremely high expectations just know youre cooked bro </3

Later at lunch, I was just steaming mad and lowkey on the edge of a breakdown cus I had already been having a shitty week, and she comes up to me and says ""Hey I think we did pretty okay on the presentation, I'm happy with my grade and I think I did a good job"" NOT... REALLY..... :,(

602,1jqoxm4,Not the A-hole,"AITA Am I wrong, what would u do?","My mom is a 57yo widow. No mortgage. Pays utilities and property taxes $5000/year. Middle sister lives in basement, pays $800/month, currently in school and working. Brother going to school and works, pays some of the bills. Mom had a workplace injury but was cut off workers comp because she refused to increase hours against her doctor’s advice. My youngest sister’s husband’s does mom’s income taxes. Got a text from youngest sister stating mom made below $20,000 last year and asked for us to pitch in monthly to offset bills. This isn’t the first time we have helped our mom keep her in the home. Mom had to get a heloc to pay unpaid property taxes in the amount of $20,000 about 7 years ago or more when I had suggested to sell and buy smaller home. Youngest sister and husband convinced her to stay and borrow against home instead. Mom received $60,000 from sale of her mother’s home after she died, paid off the heloc but is now left with none of it. Mom claims she had to use it to pay bills. I have no issue helping my mom again but I don’t want to just keep throwing money at her because it’s not solving the real problem. Selling the house to rent is too expensive. She will not sell and move in with me either. I asked my siblings to come over and we can discuss mom’s finances and find out where all the money is going because they have never been transparent with me about it. I’m asked to send her money but this time I’m asking questions. Nobody has agreed to have this meeting with me to go over everything. I feel suspicious about that. I feel there is something being hidden from me. I don’t care what my mom does, it is her money. It’s not my business. But when my youngest sister keeps asking for us to send her money I feel like I should know a little more. My mom has never been good with money and often spends beyond her means. She also lies and hides a lot until things get so bad and she almost loses her home will she speak up. My youngest sister insists that she doesn’t feel our mom is mismanaging money it’s just simply not earning enough that’s the problem. I feel like there’s more to it. I instead, went and bought my mom some groceries and I will be more than happy to help her that way as opposed to just sending an e transfer every month. I have asked 3 times for everyone’s availability so we can talk about it and nobody has responded.  Things are business as usual. I feel like they’ll paint me to be the bad guy here saying I’m refusing to help. All I’m asking is for transparency to really help and not just bandaid the symptoms. Am I wrong? I’ve always been left out of things with them and they never tell me anything until there is fighting amongst them. Everyone spills the beans there. I just have a bad feeling that they don’t want me to know where her money really went. Thoughts? "
603,1jqow2f,Asshole,WIBTAH for telling my mom to stop talking in English?,"(18) live with my parents. English is not our first language, and while it's more common now, my mom didn’t grow up speaking it much. Because of this, she a lot of times makes grammatical mistakes or mispronounces words.

Recently, a relative from another English-speaking country got engaged. Their fiancé is from our country and speaks our native language fluently. When my mom spoke to him for the first time, he was speaking in our traditional language, but she chose to respond in English. Her English isn’t perfect(grammatical errors, and being unable to find the right word), so it felt a bit unnatural. Not to mention there were a lot of people on the video call all talking in our traditional language.

A few days later, we had guests over who also spoke our traditional language, but my mom still tried to speak in English with them. I am noticing this pattern and i of genuine concern of her image wanna ask her about this. 

I don't  mean to hurt her feelings, but now I’m wondering—WIBTAH for bringing it up ?

604,1jqoa34,Not the A-hole,AITA for not financially supporting my husband's parents?,"About 1.5yrs ago my (33F) husband's (32m) three siblings decided they were each going to give $100/mo to their parents (66F and lower 60sM). My husband lost his job last May and stopped contributing the $100, and his unemployment payments ran out in December. We have been living off of my salary and he donates plasma, we share money and discuss all expenses but I have the final financial say (it was that way before as well, because I'm very good with money and he prefers me to take care of it). He was making about the same as me before so we've had to adjust our lifestyle a ton with our income being cut in half, but there are some fun things we still do, like we still travel occasionally because we have points for flights and we stay with friends for free.

Last night he got called to a family meeting where he found out his dad is leaving his mom, this has happened before a few times and they worked it out but this time it seems final. They own their house fully and his dad said he would be willing to sign it away to MIL for $25k, the house is worth a lot now as it's in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood so this is wayyyy less than his half would be if they sold it. 

My husband and his siblings got dinner after to discuss the situation and how they were going to help their mom, and during that conversation they got onto him about not contributing the monthly $100. They said it was a bad look that we are still going on trips. He explained that they are very cheap trips because we don't pay for flights or lodging and said he has no income. They basically said it should come out of my income then since we're a household.

He asked me if we could contribute the monthly $100 and I said not until he has a job and we stabilize. We squeak by but we are not in any position to have another monthly bill. He understood, as he always does.

Some additional context, my MIL is a lovely person and I also get along super well with his siblings. There is a bit of a cultural difference at play here, because I come from a culture where parents would rather die than take money from their children and in his culture it's common for children to financially support their parents. I love my MIL but I don't feel great knowing that we are her retirement plan to be honest, especially since we plan to have kids of our own soon and I would also like us to retire someday. It's $100 a month now but I know this monthly amount isn't going to be the end of it and it doesn't quite sit right with me, even outside of our current financial situation, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

TL;DR: Husband doesn't have a job. His siblings want us to continue give their mom $100 a month like we used to for both parents because we still travel and I told him we can't until he has a job.

I genuinely want to know the truth because I'm feeling weird about the whole thing, AITA for being the reason we are not currently contributing $100 a month to my in-law(s)?

EDIT: To address some frequent questions/points:

-It's pretty clear they do not plan on supporting their dad financially, he has been crappy in the way he has treated their mom so as far as I know, the monthly support in the future would be going to just mom.

-Mom plans to take out a loan for the 25k. Dad is asking for it in exchange for signing his rights away. The best solution would definitely be to pay the 25k first and get it in her name, and then sell the house and she gets all the proceeds. If she kept it the house would be later inherited by him and his siblings, but it makes more sense to all of them (and me) for mom to have the money while she's alive. But she does not seem to want to sell the house. We'll see what happens.

-Mom works at a chain tax-prep place, dad doesn't work. They are not disabled.

-The money started because sister found out parents got food from a food bank

-Husband absolutely does need to get a job, he has had some good interviews lately so hopefully he hears something positive back"
605,1jqnzh5,Not the A-hole,AITA if I ask my neighbour to stop smoking outside his front door?,"I live on the second floor of a small apartment building and my neighbour's front door is underneath my bedroom window. He will stand outside and smoke ~5 times a day and the wind will blow it into my bedroom if I have the window open, or into my living room if I have my balcony door/window open (which I tend to do quite often, especially now it's getting warmer). I'm not a smoker and don't want my flat to smell of smoke, and my other half is asthmatic, so would I be in the wrong to ask him to go slightly further afield? 

They have a back door which faces a park and is below my kitchen, but the walkway to my front door would act as a buffer for the smoke to not come up. There's also a huge green space in front of his front door which he could use. I haven't asked yet because I don't want to seem rude or selfish. 

TIA 

ETA - obviously I do close my windows when he lights up. It's just not something that I'd ideally like to be doing once it starts getting warmer because the flat gets so hot. No, I don't expect the rest of the world to cater to me I was only asking if it /would/ be rude to ask. If he says no he says no, it is what it is. "
606,1jqn76a,Not the A-hole,AITA for not opening a chest to ease my roommates fears,"Recently we had to move some important stuff out of our family storage because of a rat chewing things up. I brought home a large chest full of family scrapbooks and pictures. It looks like an old timey pirate treasure chest with a cartoonishly large padlock. 
 
One of my roommates noticed it and asked to look inside. I told him what is was but didn’t have the key to open it. He then asked if I could break the lock so he could conform with his own eyes. I said no because it wasn’t mine to break and my family liked the charm of the lock. He got upset and insisted I either show him what’s inside or get it out the house. He’s worried there might be a weapon inside, for context he has trauma from any sort of  weapon. 

I tried assuring him there was nothing like that inside but he kept insisting I open it. I would take it out the house but i don’t want my parents to have to lug this over 100 pound chest up the stairs and no one can put their hands on the key My other roommate says I should just open it to give him peace of mind AITA because I don’t want to open it.

607,1jqn3aw,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my father that my partner may or may not attend my cousin's wedding.,"So, my father told me that my cousin is planning to get married later this year and insists that I attend with my partner. I told him I will attend, but I'd have to ask my partner whether she would come or not. Then my father says that it's rude for her to not come and it would be a huge embarrassment for him in front of our relatives if she didn't. It seems that he's been going around telling relatives about my partner and is planning to introduce her to them at this wedding.

I got angry at my father for unilaterally deciding that my partner and I will attend the wedding without talking to either of us, then calling us rude if we don't comply. Also, no wedding invitations have been sent out by the couple. This is my father giving me a heads up about the wedding after he heard about it from the couple's parents. 

Some minor details: I am not married to my partner, but have been together for over a decade, so we're de facto family. I personally don't think this is an inportant, though correct me if I'm wrong. I'm from an East Asian culture, though I have been heavily westernized. My partner is fully western.

Later in the day, I asked my partner and she said she'll come, so there's no real harm or foul in the end. But who is the asshole here?

Edit: I forgot to mention that I have since spoken with my father and he has apologized about his behaviour. So the situation has been resolved and I'm just trying to do some post-mortem analysis.

Update: my father now intends to ask my cousin if she can send me an invitation to their wedding. Fuck that. I'm not going to become the person who begs the bride to get invited to their wedding. I'm not embarassing myself or my partner like that."
608,1jqn239,Not the A-hole,AITAH for refusing to deep clean?,"
Before I get into the issue, I will give context. My fiancée (f25) and I (f24) currently live together. We both work full time jobs. She works a labor job (12-14hour days, 11 am - 11 pm) and I work an office job (8 hours a day, 8am -4pm) I’m also a full time student (4-5 online classes a semester.)

Since she’s gone most of the time, I have taken on the responsibility of most of the domestic labor. I do 95% of the cooking, laundry, dishes, care for our 6 animals (ferrets cats and a dog), making sure the house is presentable and more, while she comes home, eats and goes to bed.

Here’s where I MBTAH. We got into a huge argument where she brought up how I need to be deep cleaning more often. Her stance is that it’s disgusting not to deep clean, and deep cleaning needs to be done daily (not the whole house, but pick one area and deep cleaning) I agree with her, but my argument is that I don’t have time, and if she helped me pick up the little things, then I would. After I’m done with everything, I have limited time to study, and my grades are tanking hard. I’m unbelievably stressed as it is, to the point I don’t have time to take care of myself because I’m focused on caring. She says that I have the time and energy that she doesn’t have because she works a labor job and I just work a desk job, but mentally, I’m beyond exhausted. I explained this to her, but she doesn’t see my side and just thinks I’m lazy.

We’ve talked about this, her solution is that I do all the deep cleaning so she can relax on her days off because she’s tired and needs rest. I agree that she does because she works hard, but when do I get to rest? If I do take leisure time for myself, it’s usually met with criticism (if you had time for that, why not this?) but I can’t spend every second of my waking life working, learning, cleaning, and taking care of everyone, im going crazy, especially since what I do isn’t respected.

Currently, I’m paying all the bills and she is paying off her debt, (she paid my debt as well, I had about 4k and she has about 26k) don’t have the budget for a maid. Keep in mind, we also share a car, so I’m not getting more than 6 hours of sleep a night so I’m also exhausted. Idk what to do, and I can’t talk to her about it. Am I the asshole and just being a big baby about this?"
609,1jqn02x,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanted to see GF family with bad hygiene?,"I (29m) do not want to be around my gf's (28F) extended family.  They are nice people, but get sick very often, and have a habit of touching food with their hands when serving.  The last few times I went I got sick, because one of the members had a fever and still showed up.  Last time specifically, one of the older family members was recovering from a cold, and my gf didn't tell me, and when I got there he looked visibly sick.  She then said ""how are you feeling"", which clued me in that she already knew he was sick.  I couldn't leave immediately, the room was small and crowded, and of course I got sick.  The grandparents who come are also very old, in their 90s.  I do not want to show up anymore because I cannot afford to be sick for a week every time we hang out, and I think they are eventually going to kill the grandparents.  I don't want to be the guy that says I'm never going to family gatherings though as it puts my GF in a  weird spot after dating for 7 years.  At this point though, I've pretty much decided I'm not doing dinners with the extended family.  AITA?"
610,1jqmxhw,Not enough info,AITA for buying colored contacts without my parents permission?,"I (16F) have saved some money not a long time ago cause I was thinking of buying colored contact lenses myself as my parents won't let me get them because they think I'm too young for them. Since my debit card is connected to my dads account, I asked him to deposit the money that I saved to my card and he did it.(i still didn't tell them that i will buy contacts) So I did my research about contacts of course, then I took a look of an online contact lens website that everyone trusts and loves in my country. I saw the website was open for debit card use so I used my debit card and ordered them.(they said that it will come in a 1 week) So 2 days later, after I've already bought them both of my parents freaked out. They screamed at me and grounded me. I apologized them but they didn't forgive me. It seems like they have canceled my order. I really don't know what to say cause it was my first time buying something online with my own money and my parents still won't talk to me. I feel really sorry and I'm %100 sure that I'm the biggest AH here but I also want to know the others opinion. AITA?"
611,1jqmnsh,Asshole,AITA for telling my flatmate not to sublet her room?,"I (29F) am currently living in a flat share with a very good friend (also 29F) who I've known since kindergarden. We moved together last year in january and it has been a very good living situation until now, that I'd like to continue as much as possible exactly like this. One important thing to say about our apartment is that we are kind of living there illegally. Meaning we are living in a sublet by the actual official tenant, that wasn't approved by the landlord. She once asked the landlord what he would think of a sublet and he made it clear he doesn't want that. So, although nothing has happened until now and it's a quite unlikely too because the landlord isn't even living in the same city and doesn't come by at all, it's still a risky situation. Theoretically we could lose this apartment in a day.

Okay now to the current situation. My flatmate just recently finally finished her Master's and has planned for quite some time, that before starting a full time job she wants to go on a longer trip (6 weeks) through Asia. I have always supported that and helped her with planning a route and finding recommendations. Like two weeks ago, after being with her family for a few days, she comes back to our flat telling me she's booked the flights, accomodations and even some (2 to be exact) language schools. After I congratulated her she let me know tho that now she'll look for a sublet for her room as she has planned her budget around having someelse staying in her room and paying the rent for her. 

For me this started two big problems: 
1. I'm scared further subletting and involving even more people in this will tip over our situation and we'll both end up losing the apartment over night.
2. I'm also just finishing up my own master studies while working an intense part-time job. I'm extremely stressed and know it will only get worse from here on for the next months. Also I have been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety in the past, am still taking medication for it and just really really need a safe space where I can be calm and without worries. I don't have any sublet experience and fear having to deal with a stranger at home in my current stressed out situation will just spiral me back into a very dark place.

I have told her all of my concerns and we have spoken many many times about in the last two weeks but just can't come to a solution. 
As much as I want to help her and be understanding, I think she should have never planned this trip with not having to pay rent and no job offer yet.
She thinks there are only two solutions: either I back down and let someone stay as a sublet, or I pay the rent for her room as I am the reason she can't sublet it. I feel both solutions are not only unfair but also only good for her and neither of them good for me. 

In our last discussion I discovered that she is scared of not finding a job after coming back and having to leave the city and consequently so adamant about not paying her rent while away."
612,1jqmj93,Not enough info,AITA for asking to share a toothbrush with my girlfriend for one time?,"So I spent the night at my girlfriend’s place for the first time. We woke up, had breakfast, showered and I put on my clothes from the night before. When we were about ready to leave, I asked to borrow her toothbrush so that I didn’t have to go home before heading into the office (I have a change of clothes in my office for returning from the gym or if I spill something on myself). She got big mad and said that I was gross for even asking. It continued to blow up and I thought it was a legit question and don’t see anything wrong with it since we already exchange bodily fluids. Anyways, I get her line in the sand but would love to hear if anyone has a different way of explaining it. "
613,1jqmbu2,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my coworker interrupt me anymore?,"I've been at my job for 3 years now and in personal and professional conversation, my worker continually interrupts me. Not just me, it's everyone. Usually, someone will start to speak and after about 2 seconds, he will interrupt. Not always about the same subject, sometimes he will just spark into a completely different topic. There's professional conversations that have to happen and we literally sit next to each other. Always thought that's just how his brain works or he's got a different communication style...

  
Recently, I started just literally talking louder and not stopping when he interrupts. It usually leads to both of us talking for 1-2 seconds... sometimes he will stop/slow-down and sometimes he just keeps going almost ignoring what I'm saying. I feel crazy and I feel like everyone else at work notices. I asked him to just stop interrupting me but when I brought this up to a friend, they said that's an asshole move (didn't work btw).

614,1jqlwob,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving my boss behind at work,"Hello f21. I work at a theatre doing janitorial work part time while I go to school full time . Last night I was scheduled to work 7-10:20, to close up the theatre. At around 8:30 my boss tells me we are going to be out late tonight because she has to do inventory and she’s behind (per theatre rules someone must accompany the boss to the bank to drop off the cash made that day)  . I tell her no worries and go about my job. I end up finishing early, because nobody saw the last several movies and I’m done about 9:55 (she still hasn’t started inventory at this time I don’t know what she was doing the entire shift ) . 

No biggie I knew I was going to have to wait around. I sit there for TWO hours after I’m done doing my job, and she comes into the break room and says she doesn’t know how long she is going to be and that I now need to take 2 10 minute unpaid breaks plus a 30 minute unpaid lunch. This is about an hour of unpaid time of me just sitting there, and would put me at 1 am.

 At this point I’m annoyed, frustrated, tired, I just want to go home and smoke, and she’s just still counting away (I even asked to help her but inventory is only a manager position I guess ). I thought I was the only one around and cried for about a minute or two just letting my frustration out and she comes into and says I can leave and that she feels bad. Now I feel bad that she might’ve heard me crying or that I was upset, because it is my job to wait on her, but I didn’t think I would be sitting there for an entire extra shift and having an hour of that being unpaid.

615,1jqlj6c,Not the A-hole,AITA for embarrassing my brother infront a girl?,"(I HAD TO UPLOAD IT AGAIN) Hello everyone i know the title kinda bad but here’s wat happened. So last year we went to Texas all the way from Jamaica me,my brother and grandma for 2 weeks. First day we settled and got everything organized, it was around the 3 or 4th day we heard of a event keeping and me and bro decided to check it out and it was a decent length drive there. We got there and realize it was slightly bigger than we expected and decided to split up and meet back at the car in 2 hrs. It was bout a hour or so when he founded me and asked for the keys to get something out the car. (Side note: I am 24 and he is 18 but he only has a learners license) the 2 hrs we’re up and I got to the meet point exactly 4 mins late and I didn’t see the car so I thought he probably drove to the exit and was waiting and not dumb enough to actually drive leave me Ina foreign country and him only having a learners license. My phone was left in the car because I am a plumber and lost 2 phone to water damage I developed a bad habit of leaving it in my car so I couldn’t called. I went back around the event for 30 min and back at the meet point and exit and still no sign and I was alrdy furious. I beg a couple for a call and called my grandma to call my brother to come and pick me up waited around min when she called back and told me she isn’t getting through to him.  
   
I began to walk back and damn I got to say Texas was hot asf and it was just boiling my anger to the next limit I reached a small little town and actually had to pay someone 10usd to get a call this time my grandma actually got through to him and told him to pick me up in the town area, when he finally got here it was a total time of basically 2hrs and it wasn’t even him driving the car it was some random girl which just made me lose it even more. Turns out he meet her at the event and she somehow managed to convince him to explore some good areas (their actual words) and got lost in time After they finish chatting my ears out and finally realized I wasn’t even smiling an inch my brother started giggling chatting bout it was a honest mistake and at least I got to enjoy the event a little longer.  
  
 I simply sigh and then lost it and lashed out at him and asking him where he found the logic to left me stranded without a phone Ina foreign place and not telling me anything before he left I snatched the keys made sure he has his phone and money and left him and the girl and went home he got home about a hour after me and began chatting to my grandma saying he know he wrong and apologizes (which he didn’t) and started saying I didn’t have to embarrass him like that tho he ended up going back down home 2 days later saying he can’t enjoy a vacation with me because of my temper and behavior so gentle people AITA btw sorry if my English isn’t so English so any questions just ask me and 10usd is like 1500 in my country so I was salty I had to pay that for a single phone call"
616,1jqkb2l,Not the A-hole,"AITA for snapping at my mother when she asked when I would ""finally"" kick out my daughter?","Hi, I am fairly new to using reddit, but I have lurked on some subreddits before (including this one). Anyway, on to my problem.

I, 66f, am retired but kept very busy by caring for my mother (85f) and my disabled husband (64m). My mother does not live with us; she lives in an assisted living facility, where I visit her every few days to check up on her and see if she needs anything. During my latest visit, she brought up how I should ""finally"" kick out my daughter (29f, let's call her C).

Now for some context, yes, my daughter does indeed still live with me and my husband, for many factors including her rather fragile mental health, but what my mother does not understand is that, despite us being parent and child, we are not living in a parent and child kind of situation. We are roommates that just happen to also be family, because neither her nor my husband and I could afford places of our own in this economy. We are dependent on C just as much as she is dependent on us.

C holds down a full time job, which doesn't pay great, but not awfully either. She pays her fair share in rent, utilities and groceries, does her fair share of chores and sometimes even takes over some of my chores when she feels that I need a break. I cook on weekdays when C has to work, but C has weekends off so she takes over cooking duties then. She has a savings account for emergencies, she pays for the family Netflix account, and even spends some of the fun money she has left over every month (which isn't much) on little treats for my husband and me, no matter how often I ask her not to waste what little money she has to enjoy life on us.

So with all of that as background, my mother's comments made me pretty angry, because C does so much to not be a burden to my husband and me, despite me telling her that I love her and could never see her as a burden. I also fear my mother may have planted that thought in her head when I wasn't around. Meanwhile, all my mother seems to do is demand, demand, demand. She has nurses at her disposal in that assisted living facility, and people who do grocery runs for her. But she never uses these services and demands that I do everything for her instead. She demands all of my time, energy and attention. I suspect she may want to push me to kick C out so she could move in with my husband and I and force me to be her full-time caretaker.

I was already having a shitty day, so I just snapped and told her that C's living situation is none of her damn business. She started crying and asked why I would yell at her for just being concerned.

So Reddit, AITA for snapping at my mother?

617,1jqjtkq,Not enough info,AITA for making a scene in front of our friends,"Last edit: Nico an Nick are our couple friends
I am married to John (not real names obvs)

Edit for better flow

English is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes


On Sunday we were at some very close friends' house, having a nice time. I (44f) and the wife, Nico (60f) are both therapists. At some point Nico started to tell us about meeting a fellow therapist during her flight to a conference. How he looked very well, has a 6yo (he's also 60) and just got married a third time. I said that 16 years ago, after having my first child, we (me and the 60yo guy) shared a practice (that was very close to my house) before coming to work full time in my own practice and that I hadn't seen him since.
Now comes the tricky part. My husband started getting angry saying he didn't know I worked at that practice, do I think it's normal that he didn't know that?!? I replied that he probably doesn't remember, it's only been for 6 months or so and that it's not possible he DIDN'T KNOW at all. He kept pushing, huffing and puffing about it and at some point I raised my voice telling him I WASN'T SNEACKING OFF TO SEE CLIENTS behind his back and he probably didn't really care that much about my work with all of his travelling to exotic places for work (he had for 22 years a great job that took him all over the world for weeks at a time, I am still angry and resentful about that). How would I even go about it? He got upset, our friends were kind of embarassed (I appologized to them the next day, they were gracious about the whole thing) and it pretty much ruined the mood for everybody.
So AITA for telling him he didn't care that much and that what he was saying was kind of crazy? I am TA for sure for not keeping it together especially as we were at our friends' house.logized to them the next day, they were gracious about the whole thing) and it pretty much ruined the mood for everybody.

618,1jqjan6,Everyone Sucks,AITA for reacting in anger to my brother telling me he will not attend my wedding?,"My (m35) brother (m24) called me 2 days before my wedding and informed me that he would not be attending.

Background: my fiancée and I have been planning this wedding for over a year, and my brother is one of the first people we invited. He is part of the bridal/groom party. Our parents will not be attending, but I expected that, as it is a secular wedding, and they are pretty hardcore legalist Protestant Christians, and anything not revolving around God, or including alcohol or non-Christian music is considered sinful. My brother would have been the only part of my nuclear family to attend, and that is important to me. We are the only two siblings. 

Lately, he's been financially underwater, due to some questionable decisions he made in the past (financed a truck he couldn't afford primarily), as well as suffers from anxiety. 

He called me yesterday evening, 2 days before our wedding, and informed me he would not be going. He cited that he does not do well in crowds, and barely knows anyone there, and that he'd be unable to attend, since his anxiety would be too much to handle. He also cited, that even if he did attempt to attend, his truck would be repossessed the day of our wedding. I told him I'd pick him up, and that there were multiple members of our extended family attending, to which he replied that he didn't really know those people. 

I then reacted in near-rage, telling him to f*** off and not contact me again, and hung up. A few minutes later I called to apologize, but the call went to voicemail. I followed up with texts apologizing, but telling him to get help for his anxiety, and that I would need time for our relationship to bounce back from this. 

AITA for chewing him out, and for being irate at his reasoning to not attend my wedding? I feel like I overreacted to the situation. I've also been told I reacted accordingly, as in our cultures (Central American and US-American), weddings are a massive deal in our lives and not to be taken lightly. 

EDIT: I myself suffer from Bipolar II Disorder with anxiety, so for those wondering if I am unable to understand what he's feeling, I certainly do; however, through professional help, I've managed to find ways to manage it. Him and I have bonded over me helping him with tips to manage anxiety that I've received from my therapists. 

EDIT II: I failed to mention, in between him informing me of his reasoning for not coming, and me boiling over and shouting at him, I handed the phone to my fiancee, who was calmer than me (who was feeling frustration and anxiety) to speak and plead with him to come, and he gave her all the same reasons, telling her that if we ""did not understand, then sorry but I can't come,"" which was when I took the phone back and had the anger outburst. Unsure if this helps at all, but felt that it was important to the series of events. 

EDIT III: For those urging me to seek help for anger management, this is a complete one-off outburst. I'm very level-headed, and this type of occurrence is very rare. I rarely let the anger side of the feelings wheel take hold, and even in the rare occurrence they do, it's tempered frustration at best, and not for long. "
619,1jqiyh6,Not the A-hole,AITA for finding and confirming a new room to rent without notifying my housemates in advance,"AITA for finding a room of my own without notifying in advance that I took it

I (28 F) am currently in a lease that is ending this April. The main tenants is a married couple in their 30s. We had been sharing an apartment for almost a year and at the end of February, we kicked out one of the other tenant as he due to hygienic and had been consuming a lot of electricity (After he left, the bill went from 75 each to 55 each) 

The issue is that due to the vacant room and our effortless search for a new tenant, us living in the apartment might not be feasible as I myself am in a very tight financial situation and can't afford to help pay for the vacant room. The landlord had been hussling us to find a new tenant for that room. 

For this, I had messaged the wife of the couple and she said to liase with her husband about it as she had a lot on her plate. 

For the whole of March, I had been sending links for potential units the three of us can share as we had thought it would be easier to move out together. A lot of my possible units were declined as they wanted to stay in the area while I was looking towards the East of the country as a lot of my work seem to be there lately. 

Everytime I saw the husband, I asked if there was any updates and the two of us shared our experiences finding a new unit. The latest I had heard from them is that the agent they had used to find this apartment had put the apartment up for lease again per the landlord's wishes. I was also told that he had been looking for a unit for him and his wife as well. 

For some reason, they expected me to wait until the later half of April to begin properly searching for a new place to live despite telling me that I should look for a backup. I'm already anxious about possibly being homeless in May and just 2 days ago I finally found a place that is cheaper and fits everything I needed to rent. 

Today, I messaged in our group chat telling them that I will be moving out in May as I had found a place and took the room. 

The wife got upset and told me that I should've been more considerate and honest about all of my room searching with them as they had just told the landlord that they would keep the apartment even though there was no other tenant in the other room and that they had been discussing it so much amongst the two of them and that they were being considerate about my financial situation and wished that I would be more considerate to my future housemate. 

I was stunned as I had openly told her husband about my searching, me wanting to find a cheaper place as well as find one in the east. There was no discussion from them about staying regardless and I couldn't afford paying more than I already am for rent. I had no clue but I had already taken up an offer for another place.

620,1jqixao,Not the A-hole,AITA “hurting a friend” by not approaching to her after she had a fight with a mutual friend?,"I (35f) and Anna(36f) had known each other for 7ys. We supported each other during hard times and I literally consider her as my best friend and she knows everything happening in my life. I share everything happened to me. I am more open and love to share, she seemed to be ok with it. For the last 2years we only meet once a week because of work. Anna is a soft girl who has high sensibility and can get emotionally affected by things she see on the street. She also highly values her privacy and HATES people spreading things related to her without consulting her is she is ok with it or not. She made this quite clear to me and I respect that. 

Four months ago a mutual friend showed interest in her and she didn’t like it and rejected him in a quite fierce way. The guy is also one of my best friend so he came to me to talk about it because he was frustrated  and felt uncomfortable about the way how she rejected him. Anna noticed it and decided not to talk to me about it. I think it is her right and because of she really values her privacy and I was afraid of marking her felt forced to tell me things that she may not felt comfortable to share. So I didn’t go to ask her about it. I thought she will or will not come to talk to me about it when she is ready. It is her choice. Also I feel this thing happened between two adults and I am not part of it so I should let themselves to deal with it. If anyone wants me to be there I will be there to support whoever needs my accompany. However, then Anna was quite distant and cold to me, I felt it and felt super hurt. Cause I knew she might feel super bad about what happened between them and I was worried about her and was willing to be there for her after what happened. But again we are adults, I know friends come and go. So I respected her decision and slowly moved on. We never meet in private time anymore. I thought this is the end of our interaction. However, four months later she asked me to meet her after work, I thought she wants to catch up and I travelled 1h to meet her near her house. It turns out she wanted to make it clear that I don’t deserve her friendship anymore because I was involved in that situation ( for being a mutual friend) and was not there for her.  She said and I quote here :” i was hurt by that situation.” So I asked her directly: you mean I hurt you? She answered: yes, that is how she felt. I repeated the question with astonishment and she confirmed that is what she really felt. On that night I totally speechless, also because she firmly believes I was entangled with both of them and their unsuccessful relationship, but I literally think that is none of my business and she disagrees.  After that night it took me three weeks to think about what really happened between us, and make me wonder if I am the A in that situation. So AITA? "
621,1jqiklq,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my mum in the ambulance with me?,"I (then 17f, now 18f) was at school when I suddenly started feeling weird. I could barely breathe, was shaking like a leaf and incredibly dizzy. Me and another student went outside for fresh air, but it only got worse. My teacher was afraid I was having a seizure and called an ambulance. To make this clear, I live in Germany, so an ambulance is paid for by the insurance. She also called my parents, who tried calling me to tell me I wasn't allowed to go into the ambulance, even telling my boyfriend to get me to refuse being taken to the hospital. He had come over to me while I was outside to check on me, but I am incredibly uncomfortable with people close to me seeing me when I'm not feeling well, so I asked him to leave, which he did.  
He told my boyfriend that he should tell me I should stop thinking only about myself since this isn't only about me.

The paramedics took me to the ambulance, since I kept passing out. In the ambulance, they ruled out a seizure and any physical reason, but rather that I was in psychological shock from a lot of stress. While I was in the ambulance, my mother arrived and kept screaming that I should let her in so she could talk with the paramedics to let me go, which I didn't want, since at that time I was still feeling awful. And knowing my mother, I knew how it would go. She is a surgeon herself, and would've debated them on every point possible. She can be a very nice person, but also an absolute Karen. I'm talking yelling at airport staff because the flight was delayed and making a handyman cry for installing something wrong.

The driver told her I didn't want her in the ambulance with me and they'd take me to the hospital. I was placed on a short psychological hold for half an hour, in which they told me I should just tell them everything that was going on at the moment, which helped a lot and I stopped shaking. They released me after an hour, since there wasn't anything physically wrong with me.

Well, I called my mum to tell her I got discharged. She didn't ask if I was okay. Not once. Was completely ice cold. And that she wouldn't pick me up immediately, since she had to work and walk the dog. She works from home (for an insurance company, not a pracitcing surgeon anymore) and can place her hours throughout the day however she wants. I had to wait two hours outside the hospital, since my backpack was still at school, including my wallet with my bus card, my lunch and water. I hadn't eaten anything that day, which she knew. Luckily my boyfriend lives close to the hospital and came over with his bike and brought me something to eat and drink.

She was pissed when she picked me up. Pissed as in yelling at me why I would be so selfish and wouldn't let her, my own mother in the ambulance. This is where I may be the AH. A lot of the stress I had was also caused by my parents, who I had an awful relationship with at the time. And I knew my mother would only further escalate the situation if I had let her in.  
Whenever this topic comes up, she still gets angry at me.

AITA?

623,1jqhgsx,Asshole,AITA for getting into an argument with my mum because I had to cancel plans with friend?,"I (19) had plans to see a film with my friend from college. I don’t drive because I can’t afford lessons and I have a disability that would make it harder for me to learn. 

I was planning on taking the bus but unfortunately I live in a small village and busses are few and far between especially on a Sunday. I had asked my mum for a lift into town so I could catch the bus to meet my friend a week ago.

I got home from college today after explaining to her what my plans for Sunday were last night. And what time I would want to catch the bus and whatnot. 

She now says I can’t go because she won’t be able to take me to town and back because we have family coming for lunch. I told her that I’ve had this planned for a week and I would like to see my friend, we haven’t seen each other in a year and it would be nice to spend some time with her. My mum then said that we’ve had this dinner planned for months.

My problem is that she could have told me this when I made the description of when I wanted to meet or where if she had told me she couldn’t go because she has other engagements at the beginning I wouldn’t be upset. I’m upset with her because she could have told me this before I made plans to begin with and I’ve now had to cancel. 

Am I the asshole? "
624,1jqgh6r,Asshole,AITA for washing my hands by the trash can?,"I go to a small temple near my home sometimes. After praying, all the devotees are served dinner.

I come from a culture/religion where people typically eat with their hands. There are curries, gravies, and other things that get your hands dirty. We are given a napkin but that is not enough to properly clean our hands and mouths. 

Get this - there is no bathroom or sink in the temple premises. None of the nearby stores have a bathroom. I feel like I would be the asshole if I went to a nearby restaurant to use their bathroom without buying anything. The train station that I go to to come back home has a bathroom but that bathroom closes pretty early.

So in order to properly wash my hands after eating, I usually get a cup of water from a water filter near the trash can, open the trash can with my foot (there is a pedal to open it), and then pour water over my hands, with the water flowing into the trash can. I then use an extra napkin to dry my hands and get rid of any remaining residue. Once I reach home, I use soap to wash my hands nicely.

Up until yesterday, no one seemed to care that I was washing my hands this way. But yesterday, a volunteer at the temple seemed a bit disgusted or I guess he had a disapproving face when he saw me doing this. I just said sorry. He said ""it's not about being sorry"". Another volunteer - maybe his wife or someone else - told the man to just let it go. I didn't know how to respond, so I just left after that. 

I'm thinking of getting hand sanitizer or a small pack of disinfectant wipes with me moving forward to clean my hands after eating. 

But do you think I was the asshole for how I washed my hands up until now?

625,1jqfpg9,Not the A-hole,AITA for making a comment about my friend not having a job after she expected us to bye her food.,"Awhile ago, I was in the car with some friends, and we were all driving to an art store. One of my friends (let’s call her Anna) mentioned she was hungry. Her boyfriend was in the back seat with her, and they started talking about what to eat.

For context, we are all adults, but Anna doesn’t work and doesn’t like spending her boyfriend’s money. We suggested a pizza place, but she said, ""Well, I don’t mind eating off your plates."" Without really thinking, I responded, ""Of course you don’t.""

The car got quiet after that. We ended up skipping food and just went to the art store, but Anna stayed in the car, pouting. Later, she got upset with me, saying I made her feel bad for not having a job. Her boyfriend also told me I shouldn’t have said that.

For context, Anna can work but has chosen not to. I didn’t mean to make her feel bad, but I also felt like it was an awkward comment for her to make in the first place. Now I’m wondering if I was out of line.

AITA?

Edit for context: She’s not really a friend anymore, just my ex’s sister and my daughter’s aunt. When this happened, I was living with my ex and his family—seven people total. At the time, only her boyfriend and I were working. My ex was doing college work and getting paid for it, while his parents (both ex-military and 100% disabled) lived off their benefits. Anna had tried to file for disability but was denied, yet still refused to work or help out around the house.

I don’t live with them anymore, but I do have anxiety and am on the spectrum, so I struggle with social cues sometimes. My brain just resurfaced this memory, and I started feeling bad about it again. I wanted to know if I was actually in the wrong or if I was overthinking it."
626,1jqf0p4,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I asked my bf's sister to move out or start paying rent.," Hi, first time posting here (i think)
 
So, I have this issue, I (34F) and my bf (41M) moved together 3 years ago, a year and a half ago I agreed for his sister to move with us so she can work in our town and I agreed for her not to pay anything so she can save money to buy her own house. 

 Coming to today's time, in November we all moved to a house I bought in my name and, before moving, I told my bf his sister can live with us until May and not pay anything but she needs to start looking for a new place. 
 May it's approaching and she still hasn't looked for any new place, insists she wants to buy a house on auction but states she can't get a mortgage and I feel like I have no personal space in my own home because I only have the bedroom I share with my bf and the lounge where there are boxes on top of boxes of his stuff. 

 I want to help but at the same time I feel that now I am being taken advantage off, 1st, if she can afford to look for an auction home she has enough in savings to move (if she does find a house and wins the auction she would have to pay the full price on the spot) but says she can't get a mortgage because she doesn't have enough savings. 

 I told my bf I am hoping she moves soon but it feels like it's all being downplayed and I am not taken seriously. 

So, wibta if I ask her to pay half the mortgage to live here? And to explian, my bf pays bills so, of course  I am not asking him to chip on the monthly mortgage payment as well. "
627,1jqdgzt,Not the A-hole,AITA if I don't go to my sister's overseas religious wedding?,"I (35F) am very low contact with my younger sister (28F), the Golden Child.

She got married legally last year in a destination wedding + holiday (beach destination in our state) paid for by our parents. I paid my own way; parents paid for sister + BIL's flights, accommodation, sister's dress and entire wedding. I delayed the start of my new job to go, and was unpaid during this trip. 

I didn't enjoy it but endured because my parents demanded I attend. I didn't expect to be invited, to be honest, and doubt I would have been had my parents not been holding the money bag.

To clarify, I have no ill will towards my sister. She's found a good man and I'm happy for her. I gave the happy couple a generous cash wedding gift. As far as I'm concerned, I've discharged my duty as her sister.

In the meantime, she's had her husband convert to our family's religion and now plans to have a religious wedding overseas in our family's country of origin. 

He converted locally. They have a religious community they're part of locally. They've lived together for 4 years and co-own an apartment. They could have had one wedding, religious and legal combined; there was no rush regarding the timing of the legal wedding. In my view, this is just a way for them to get yet another holiday out of my parents.

The financial choices my parents make are their own and none of my business. I don't need their money, and don't make any claim to it.

That being said, I don't feel obligated to spend my money taking time off work and travelling overseas to attend my sister and BIL's second wedding/holiday.

When I thought about it, I realised I would rather be at work; I enjoy being at work more than time in my sister's company.

My mother is trying to emotionally blackmail me into going with the classic ""...what will the family think?!"" 

I don't care what the family will think. If I'm taking time off work, and spending money, I want it to be on something I want to do and will enjoy. I've already discharged my duty in attending her wedding. So, AITA?

"
628,1jqdcb9,Not enough info,WIBTA telling my parent-in-law to move back to their home,"tl;dr 4 years ago my parent-in-law went to visit me which later become permanent residency at my home. I'm thinking to tell them to go back at their home.

  
**Long Version:**

4 years ago during covid years my parent-in-law went to visit me because me and wife were expecting a baby. Initially I was thinking it's going to be few months stay until we get hang around the baby, turned out they were living permanently with me till today. My retiree father-in-law even find job in second month stay.

My house only have 1 spare bedroom which later occupied by parent-in-law, so I am forced to sleep with toddler son till today.

**The Problem Right Now**

Father-in-law is heavy smoker (like 1-2 packs a day), but what disgusts me the most is he will keep smoking even when my son (or even neighbor's toddler) is around. Dude smoke in 1 meter radius around literal newbon (saw it with my own eyes).

Mother-in-law is helping around the house and cook for the house. But she forced us to live in her way which ended up in us eating her bland / too salty / too earthy food every day. Plus she complains A LOT.

Since it's 2 pair of adults living together there is SO MUCH clutter. I have entire cabinet filled out just to store their tupperware, outdoor desk placed in pathway, house plants more than I can count, and overall random shits they don't want to throw away.

My son is 4 y.o. now, he is around that age where starts asking if he could sleep on his own.

**The Plan**

I just want to tell them ""Hey, can you guys go back to your own house?"", I will pay the transport, me and wife even set up monthly allowance for them.

To me what I'm thinking seems generous enough. But parent-in-law might see it differently, like we hate them so I'm throwing them away. But They already have a decent house in their home town. My current home is just company housing with total strangers around, but in their home town they could have fmaily members nearby. 

Father-in-law thinking he wants to keep working and live with me because their hometown don't have good job market. But dude is literally 72 y.o. this year, last month he was forced to retire again by his employer. Dude, just stay retired and enjoy your life."
629,1jqcran,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not cancelling my friend from a trip she bailed on, and refusing to cover her costs?","Hi Reddit,

I (18M) booked a group holiday months ago with three friends. I’m the main booker, so everything goes through me. We agreed right at the start: if anyone cancels for any reason, the costs are on them. Everyone said yes.

Now, one of my friends (18F) suddenly decides she doesn’t want to go anymore. Not because of an emergency, illness, or money trouble, but because of “tension in the group”. 

She asks me to cancel her. I contact the travel agency and find out:
	•	It would cost her €471 in cancellation fees
	•	And me and the other two would have to pay €240 more each, since the total cost gets split over fewer people

So I say: absolutely not. I’m not making everyone else pay because she changed her mind.
I also contacted the agency to tell them not to make any changes to the booking unless I give written permission (which I haven’t).

She keeps pushing for the booking number and tries to contact the agency herself. I eventually give it to her, but I’m clear: you don’t get to bail and expect us to clean up the mess for you.

Now she’s mad. She’s acting like I’m cold and unreasonable for not just “handling it.” She’s being super passive-aggressive, playing the victim, and acting like she’s taking the high road — when in reality, she’s just making everything harder for the rest of us.

I’ve stopped replying to her messages at this point. We’re still going on the trip, and her spot is just going to stay empty.

So… AITA for not cancelling her and refusing to take on extra costs for a trip she voluntarily dropped out of?

630,1jqcf27,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to apologize to my dad?,"I (22F) yelled at my dad (50M) yesterday after he lit up firecrackers indoors, feet away from us while we're having dinner, he's not mentally ill.

Hearing yelling itself gets me super anxious let alone hearing the sound of firecrackers couple feet away from me, I yelled at him and told him to grow up, which isn't like me at all, I never lash out or get angry, but right there I lost control. He although, looked at me with a grin and said ""the next one will be aimed at you"" i looked him dead in the eyes and told him to try, in my head I was sure he won't do it, but he was about to actually do it, but mom stepped in and threatened to leave the house.

He stopped after my mom yelled at him, and acted like the victim, now is giving everyone the silent treatment.

My mom told me today that i should apologize for raising my voice at him, I refused and she said ""he's your father, doesn't he deserves an apology even if you didn't do anything wrong?"" I was speechless. I know I'm not in the wrong here.

I'm sick of apologizing for not doing anything wrong, low grades, not greeting him properly first thing in the morning, hiding bad grades, hiding good grades cuz it's never enough, laughing loud, making jokes, laughing to myself...im done,  this is ridiculous. 

Edit: I can't move out, I'm a full time student, the only time I get to be away from home is being at uni dorms, I came back home 4 days ago after being at the dorms for 5 weeks(i try to stay as much away as possible). Also it's culturally known here that girls and boys don't move out of their parents house until they get married so after graduation im living back at home with them. Last time I had a conversation with my mom about moving out she said ""how about you also find a man and propose to him"""
631,1jqbj1t,Not the A-hole,AITA for not willing to split the cost of a group gift when I wasn’t included in the card,"One of my friends got a new job recenly and some my friends decided to get her a little gift. I was in the group chat where it got brought up, but I was super busy with studying and didn’t say much. A couple people were throwing around ideas and I figured they’d update us later.

Well, last weekend they gave her the gift which is a airpod pro and posted a little photo of her holding it with a card. I didn’t even know they picked something already. I also wasn’t asked to sign the card or even told when they were giving it to her.

Then that same night, one of the girls Venmo requested me $20 for my “share.” I asked what it was for and she said, “the gift, obviously,” like I should’ve just known.

I told her I didn’t get to sign the card or even know what they picked, and she said it didn’t matter because I was part of the group and it’s just what we all agreed to. But like… I never agreed. I dont think i was included. I wasn’t even asked...

After that they are saying I’m making it awkward and that it’s not about the money, it’s about celebrating a friend, but I kinda feel like I was treated like an afterthought and still expected to pay.

I got something small as usual because I’m trying to save some cash. So I had water and a basic pasta that was on special. A few others did the same. But one of my friend ordered a appetizer, a big entrée, and dessert, and she got a drink too. No judgment, she can do her, but it definitely added up.

When the check came, she suddenly goes, “Let’s just split it evenly.” I was like, what? I thought we were all paying for what we ordered. She said it would be easier and that it’s “what we always do,” which is not true by the way.

I told her I only brought enough for what I ate, plus a tip. She rolled her eyes and said it’s not that deep, and that I’m being cheap over a few bucks. But it wasn’t a few bucks. It would have almost doubled what I was planning to spend.

I didn’t budge and paid for my stuff only. My other friends didn't care and split the bill evenly.  Now she’s being super passive and told our other friend that I embarrassed her in front of everyone and made her look greedy. But like, she assumed we’d cover part of her extra food without even asking.

633,1jqb3qz,Not the A-hole,WIBTAH if I didn’t attend my pinning ceremony?,"I am currently a vet tech student and myself and my 8 class mates are set to graduate in May. We started with ~25 students, and only 8 of us made the cut. We are so proud of ourselves and each other. Most of us are planning to walk at graduation. Where I'm from, it is also customary to hold a pinning ceremony for those graduating from healthcare programs. Those held for nurses for humans are most well known, but vet techs have one too. At my school, the previous pinning ceremonies have been organized and planned completely by the 2 instructors and their students, so it is a very emotional and personal ceremony, it isn't public like graduation.

However, this year the school got a new president. He has decided that, for some ungodly reason, he must attend every pinning ceremony, for EVERY ALLIED HEALTH PROGRAM. In order to make this work, he has mandated that different programs have to do their pinning ceremonies TOGETHER. This means strangers we never met are now a part of it, we can no longer pick a time that works for us, and we can't hold a tradition of previous classes where our instructor plays a slideshow of pictures of us as we progressed. To say my class is pissed is an understatement. We tried everything we could to undo this change but we were ignored. We let it go after a little bit, until recently.

We were just updated and told that we are now mandated to wear our school issued scrubs. While normally this wouldn't be a big deal (and is actually quite common) it was the straw that broke the camel's back for us. We talked as a class, got some strong feels out, and elected a class representative to speak to the director of allied health to try and get this undone, and maybe even speak to the president of the school.

Multiple classmates of mine are saying they will not attend the pinning ceremony if things aren't changed. I agreed with this. However, my parents are nurses (had their own pinning ceremony) and they think my class is overreacting, and that no one should skip a pinning ceremony regardless because of it's symbolism (the vet tech/nurses oath is recited). However, the pinning ceremony in nursing is very serious and has a rich history, and the vet tech one does not to my knowledge. This is why I have no problem skipping it, but my parents still don't agree. On top of that, one of my classmates can't back out bc she has family flying in specifically for the pinning ceremony. So basically, WIBTAH if I didn't go? Should my class just suck it up? I really feel unsure."

She immediately knew that it was someone from church and because of the contact photo she kinda had an idea of who he was, and since i  had him labeled as ""Heartbreaker ❤️😈🫶🏻"" in my contacts (because ik there's absolutely zero chance that he would ever really like me back), she's immediately like ""Ooooooh who broke your heart????"". Since she had my phone in her hand she sends a message (from ""me"") saying: ""Heyyyy I like youuu"" 

I had no idea she sent that, but when i get my phone back (about five minutes later), i see the text and go ABSOLUTELY BALLISTIC. i have to quickly sort it out by saying that the other girl sent it, but idk if he believed me. 

I confronted the girl (she's 14 and I'm 16) an tell her what she did was wrong and told her how mad i was at her, but she kinda brushed it off as nothing but a ""joke"".

Now, idk about everyone else, but BREAKING INTO MY PHONE AND TEXTING SOMEONE ISNT A ""JOKE"".

636,1jq85m7,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling a friend to piss off and find some other chew toy after I ""disrespected"" her for sending her a message on Steam?","We were friends for a long time. About 3 years. Recently she expressed a want to play Baldur's Gate 3 Co-Op with me. I thought yay, that sounds fun, been meaning to buy it and that sounds great. But recently, I sprained the fuck out of my ankle, and whilst I was at home nursing it, trying to let it get better, I saw she was playing Dead by Daylight. All I sent her was ""Don't die, pretty Ashley! <3"" ...



And this apparently set her off. Because she told me once ""I don't like getting Steam messages."" Okay, sure, whatever, I went and forgot that constituent that apparently only recently surfaced, and I was in pain, I wasn't thinking about it, just a ""have fun, don't die"", y'know, regular Steam message.



""I've told you before I hate getting Steam messages. You can Discord me just fine, you knew this, and you sent the message anyways. Now you're playing the victim card. You're known for annoying people until they get annoyed with you, and that's why I removed you from my Friends List on Steam.""



Didn't remove me from her server or from the Discord Friends List. But just silently removed me, freaked me out, made me feel like shit - I thought I genuinely did something to offend her... and it was this.



And this has been going on for some time. This seemed to be some grudge from when I moderated a friend of ours' Twitch, and I found a way around Channel Point payment for redeeming soundbites. I jokingly said ""I have the power to make all the sounds!"" and they BOTH thought I was going to troll. And I was their friend for YEARS long before that incident even happened, and I never once just kept spamming sounds. I tried to time them for comedy.



Like the reverb fart.mp3 being played when a gust of wind happened in a game or something. Something stupid, comedic, and hilarious. That's my game, making people smile and laugh.



So I stood up for myself, I went through 8 years of a toxic relationship that turned out to be a catfishing, and eventually I found the power to say ""fuck you, I'm not being your toy, I'm out, twat-waffle"" and I did the same with Ashley.



She kept repeating ""You fucking knew it pissed me off and you did it anyways. You just did, never thought,"" I WAS IN PAIN ENOUGH TO BE SENT TO URGENTCARE AND HAVE XRAYS. Sor-ry!



So I sent her ""I'm not putting up with your petty horseshit. Removing a friend over something as innocuous as a Steam message is beyond fucked in the head. It's petty. It's bullshit. You NEVER had a problem with it before. I'm done. I'm out. I did nothing wrong.""



And I can't help but feel like I was the asshole in the end, but that's literally all it was ""Good luck, have fun"" THE MOST SAID PHRASE AMONGST GAMERS.



I'm wondering if this is some petty grudge against me over that ""incident"" or her despair over some guy she has a crush on going into the military soon, and I'm just some nearby ""acceptable target"" because she never confessed to him or some shit, but she didn't want to talk like a functioning adult."
637,1jq7lz6,Asshole,AITA am I wrong for the way I responded,AITA so my fiancé was on her way to work during a really bad storm She calls me while I’m at work and ask was I busy I say no She tells me the storm is really bad and she’s scared I ask how far away she is from work she gets mad at me for asking that Later I explain I asked to know where to go if something went wrong she was not hearing it saying I’m wrong and she won’t call me for peace of mind again I’m just lost

639,1jq76c5,Not the A-hole,AITA for not correcting my grandma’s misunderstanding?,"My(15) dad(38) regularly sends me to the bookshop to buy these books for him. He’s too embarrassed to go buy them himself since the genre/category is romance and women’s fiction. Won’t do online shopping either since he hates filling in his information online. Afraid of getting hacked.

Anyway, I ran into my grandma(dad’s mom) at the shop yesterday. At first she was pleasantly surprised. Then she noticed the book I was carrying, frowned and said I’m too young to be reading such things, and that my dad’s being an irresponsible parent for letting me read them.

I wasn’t sure how to proceed. On one hand, he specifically told me it’s ’between us’ - no one is to know. On the other hand, I know how much her and Grandpa’s approval means to him. In the end I chose to keep my mouth shut.

She told me to have lunch with her and while we were at the table, waiting for food, she called and berated my dad. Told him he must have lost his mind to be letting his teenage kid read toxic, abusive romances.

Dad seemed pretty embarrassed when I got home and told me I should have said something before she called and chewed him out."
640,1jq6pb2,Everyone Sucks,AITA For Telling My Best Friend That She Was Overreacting About A Hypothetical Question?,"I just had a very weird(and stupid)argument with my best friend of almost 7 years. I tend to be a very blunt person without meaning to and I misunderstand social situations so maybe it's one of those times? Well, my best friend has been in many relationships, all of them ending badly. She's in a new one and she was telling me about how she shares fun hypothetical situations and he shuts it down immediately by saying ""But what if this happened-"" or ""That just can't happen because-"" When she was telling me this, it reminded me of myself. I misunderstand hypothetical situations a lot and answer the question seriously. She then said that it really made her mad and that when he took her home, she just slammed the door on his face before he could walk in. But then she mentioned how he apologized to her and they made up. This is exactly what I said in response

""You know I will tell you the truth. But I think you're overreacting kind of. I don't think he was necessarily hating on your hypothetical but maybe he's just a realistic person. But I'm glad it all worked out in the end."" My response was based on the info she gave me

Well, she got mad at me and said that I was coming at her with attitude(She was sending me voice messages, I was texting). She then said I was incorrect(which it isn't a matter of who's correct or not. It's based on opinion) and then began to chastise me for my way of thinking. It gave me an unexplainable feeling, honestly. Hearing the passive aggressiveness in her voice and babytalking me like I was stupid for saying what I said. She then shared more information that she didn't tell me beforehand about how he admitted that he was being a jerk on purpose and he knew it would bother her. But she didn't tell me that before. So I don't really know why she's upset at me for saying what I said. She said that she wanted to share a moment of how her feelings were validated by him when he apologized. But because from the language that she was using like ""He always shoots me down"", it didn't seem like she was ranting about a happy moment at all!

I apologized for offending her because I didn't mean to and I didn't know that she was trying to rant about a happy moment. I said I misunderstood what she wanted out of the conversation and I told her 

She then said ""All my emotions are supposed to be valid and hearing my best friend invalidate me while my boyfriend does really hurts me."" I don't believe all emotions are valid. Not just this situation, just life in general. And then she started crying....? I don't think she's just upset because of what I said... I feel like she's upset about something else left unsaid. 

She's not responding to me now. She has admitted to me that she has anger issues so I don't know if that's playing a role in this situation or if it's just my blunt personality and my tendency to misunderstand social cues. This whole thing is just very childish and immature. "
641,1jq6kfy,Not the A-hole,AITA My best friend thinks I’m copying her,"My best friend (29F) thinks I (28F) am copying her, but instead of telling me directly, she’s been talking to multiple mutual friends and even some of her personal friends about it. I only found out because a friend mentioned it to me.

It started when she wore an outfit to dinner, and I complimented her, saying it looked great on her. A week later, I asked where she got it because I was considering wearing it to a concert we were attending as a group. In the end, I didn’t even wear that outfit—I chose something completely different. But she still told people that me wearing the “same exact outfit” is weird.

Before the concert, she posted a group picture of all of us with her in that outfit, telling our friend she wanted everyone to know she “wore it first” even though I never wore it. 

We also share an Amazon account, so we can see each other’s purchases. I’ve been buying a lot of skirts lately because they’re trendy, and I’ve seen so many people wearing them. But now she thinks I’m copying her just because I started wearing skirts. She even told a friend that she stopped buying clothes on Amazon so I wouldn’t “copy” her anymore and switched to shopping at online boutiques since she knows I don’t shop there.

Then, I found out she also told our friend that I started wearing jewelry because of her. She recently got a tennis bracelet and sent a picture in our group chat. I said it was cute and that she inspired me to want one too, but I never even bought one. Later, I mentioned in the group chat that I wanted to start wearing jewelry again because I hadn’t in years and felt bare—especially since the rest of the girls in our group always accessorize. I even sent pictures of jewelry I liked, and none of it looked like hers. She responded saying she didn’t like any of the pieces I sent and that they weren’t cute.

A little while later, I bought a $15 ring off Amazon for a group dinner because I thought it would make my fingers look less chubby. It wasn’t designer or brand name, just something simple. Later, I found out she told our friend that she would never wear fake jewelry and that if I “couldn’t afford real jewelry, I shouldn’t be wearing any at all.” That comment really shocked and hurt me.

I don’t understand why she feels this way. I get that she has the right to her feelings, but if the roles were reversed, I wouldn’t care at all. If she wore something I wore a week later, I’d think it was cute and say, “Twinsies!” No one else in our friend group feels the way she does—everyone else loves to match and coordinate outfits.

Am I actually copying her? It was never my intention, and I’ve never worn anything similar to her before, so I don’t get why she suddenly thinks this way. I feel really hurt and haven’t felt like talking to her or patching things up because she seems so set in her opinion. It just feels so childish, especially since we’re both almost 30. It’s like high school drama all over again."

Im not going to disclose any information but this out 5 years ago when I was in middle school. My friends were terrible to me and they left me out and would only talk to me for school work answers. I stayed friends with them it was a group of 7 cause I had no other friends and didn't want to be alone. I heard them talking bad bout me sometimes but choosed to ignore it. One day I was with my friend and her phone was on and I saw a message and it was from a group chat. With everyone but me in it. I was so mad because I felt betray and saw they were talking bad about me so I looked in her phone. I knew it was wrong but I needed to know. I saw messages saying they couldn't wait till they weren't friends with me and making fun of things I did in our other groupcht with all of us. I confronted them and they got mad at me for lookin in her phone cause it was invasion of privacy. They told me I was so wrong for doin that and didn't even apologize for i. I understand why they were mad but on other hand they were being rude to me and were invading my privacy too (sending things I sent to em privately). AITA?"

644,1jq558k,Asshole,AITA For Trying To Charge My ex best friend after we stopped being friends,"   So Jasmine and I were best friends one day I got called out of p.e this was like maybe a week before Halloween. I don’t know why but I saw Jasmine who didn’t have the same period as me. And Rita which is one of her friends and I went with them to Mr.V’s office. (The dean) Jasmine said she didn’t want to be my friend so I started crying a lot like I couldn’t breathe cause at the time I couldn’t be happy by myself and like I needed friends to hang out with. 

   But she was mad cause I made a slideshow saying red flags and green flags abt her and shared it with her the Friday before. (This all was happening on a Monday) I only did it cause when I opened canva I never check my notifications so I decided to and when I did I saw she made a slideshow about me saying mean stuff abt me how I’m lazy and a slow runner. I saw it as a joke but part of me thought she was mad cause I sit in the middle in Art and her chair is special when we came in our chairs got switched and she got pissed at me over a different chair.  Anyways I apologized a lot cause I didn’t check when she made it and it was when we were both making slide shows. 

   Rita was there for some reason even though it was none of her business and it’s not like I had an option to bring someone. Jasmine kept saying I had no friends which wasn’t true I just didn’t hang out with people at lunch or nutrition. And Mr.V kept pulling me out of 7th period to say don’t mess this up and shit. Mr.V is close with Jasmine and Rita because Rita’s mom is a teacher at the school. Which made me feel like well she messed up not being friends with me. Then I realized I didn’t want to be her friend as much anymore but we were supposed to match for Halloween. I was still excited because I wanted to match with her even though i didn’t like the outfit. I was so paranoid that she would come in uniform and I would feel like shit and that’s exactly what happened. I was the only one who like bought clothes she used stuff she had before and my mom had to buy the hat for me and her. 

    So I felt bad for my mom I asked her because she was ignoring me and she said her mom didn’t want her to match with me but she brought the hat. So that made me more happy but then she said she’ll only wear it in classes we don’t have but that made no sense to me she only wore it when she had to do Art and have a costume for the costume contest. So I told her that she owes me $7 because my mom had to pay for that and you didn’t even use it she took it off after a little. So I started asking the next week I didn’t want to make her angry angry at me so I asked like 2 weeks later. 

    Thanksgiving break was coming so I texted her asking and saying that i could help her buy the new shirt she needs for a class. The teacher said if we collected bottles she could sell it for us counting it as money, I was offering to help with the bottles. She got mad at me that I didn’t say hi to her and I said sorry a lot took accountability but she was just being rude to me even though she knew what happened. So I realized I don’t want to be friends with her if she makes me want to cry myself to sleep. I also realized the money doesn’t matter I just want her to leave me alone.

Edit: It didn’t need to be that long tbh but basically my friend got mad over a slideshow and called me out of class just to tell me she doesn’t want to be friend. Then she got mad at me when I texted her if she needed help buying a shirts and when could she pay me back. She was mad because I didn’t say hi. (Ended up long messages)"
645,1jq534f,Not the A-hole,AITA for “spoiling” a family trip bc im unwilling to sleep on a blow up mattress for 2 weeks,"Where do I even begin?

My brother, sister in law and 18 month old niece live out of the country so its a big deal for them to finally come for a visit and rare that we all get to be together. My parents and SO live on the west coast and I live on the east coast. 

Anyway were are all planning on meeting for 2 weeks at my grandpa’s (RIP) old lake house that we grew up visiting. Its a super tiny lodge maybe 1000sqft MAX so surprriiissee theres only 2 bedrooms. Being the youngest I have been automatically delegated to the living room. Sleeping in there with all the cousins was fine when I was 14 but I am nearly 30 now and that damn pull out couch is 20 years older than me. Keep in mind that my fiance is coming AND meeting the family for the first time. I think she deserves to be comfortable and have some sense of privacy in a new environment. I have now mentioned to everyone that I won’t be sleeping there several times, which has been seemingly ignored and unsupported. As the youngest sibling I am not new to getting last pick but it pisses me off that this is extended into adulthood and being pushed onto my fiance.

Making it increasingly complicated is that the nearest airbnb (option 1) is a 25 minute drive and $2000usd for 5 nights. And the only RV to rent (option 2) within a 2 hour pickup is also close to $2000usd. All the nearby motels are booked up. The fact that we might not have wanted to sleep in the living room for 2 weeks was never really considered by anyone else.

My SO and I having to front this additional cost is hurtful enough let alone the rest of the family not caring or even acknowledging that we just want to have a room/decent bed. The best they have done to help resolve is help us get a tent and blow mattress for outside.

I have decided that I will go by myself and sleep in the living room for ~4 nights as that is the max amount of bad sleep I think I can handle. This solution apparently is “ruining the trip for everyone” and making it all about me, am I the asshole?

EDIT: the toddler is also sleeping in the living room because the 2nd bedroom has no extra space"
646,1jq50jb,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I told my mom that I don’t want her to come with me to my college tour?,"Okay so I know this may not seem that interesting but I need some help or reassurance. So far during the 2024-2025 school year I’ve only visited one college and that was with my bonus mom and dad. I’ve planned 3 other college visits and a doctors visit for birth control that my mom was supposed to take me to. Each and every time my mom has bailed on me saying either she forgot or that she had work, even though I would tell her weeks in advance and ask her which day would be best for her. 

A few months ago my mom has been telling me that I need to plan visits on Thursdays since she doesn’t work on those days. The only problem though was the fact that my dad worked those days. I told her this and she explained to me that she doesn’t care if my dad doesn’t come. But honestly I want him to be there cause I would hate it if I was there with her by myself. I finally picked a day to go and it’s admitted student day. But it’s the very last admitted student they’re having so I can’t miss it. I told my mom about it when I first scheduled it two months ago and she never mentioned it again. So me and my parents just assumed she wasn’t coming.

Now this is when the problem comes in, I texted her yesterday to see if she was still planning on coming and she said she was. I told her that my bonus mom, dad, and I were planning on going and I can only bring two people because we weren’t sure if she would come or not. She told me that I’ll have to choose between my bonus mom and dad because she’ll always be there unless there’s an emergency.

At this point idk what to do because I’ll feel terrible telling one of my parents that they can’t go even after we planned all this, but I’m also afraid of the backlash I’ll get from my mom and her side of the family if I tell her I don’t want her to go. So wibta if I told her no?"

If your sf doesn’t prepare for your birthday and can’t even make you or buy you a cake is that a glowing a red flag even after over 2 years? My partner literally asked for my card to go shopping at 3pm so he could go buy me a cake on my birthday and then when I was upset they made it about how I was emotional. I have been accustom to a bit more money (like being able to buy a cake the day before) but I pay for more than 60% of our stuff and I don’t even have a job ATM (it was more before) due to circumstances and they have taken advantage of that I feel. The only thing is they take care of a lot… Like some cooking, cleaning, yard-work, my care if my health is faltering and even my kids homework but not without some, reminder that they did so. Also some SLOOOOW Upgrades in my home when time allows which they like to throw in my face and tell me the will charge me for when they get mad…dang as I write this I’m just starting to get embarrassed with myself but maybe you all have some kind input because that’s really what I need AIM!

I told him I'd rather not download a whole app I've never heard of just to talk with one person and I'd prefer to just text, but he basically refused to just give me his number and told me to download the app. I even offered to email him instead, and he said he doesn't check emails.

649,1jq4nm4,Not the A-hole,AITA For Cussing Out My Elderly Grandmother For Having Cancer,"(excuse low karma, i usually just watch narraration videos like emkay but made an account to post this)

(also sorry this is gonna be a fairly long post 💀)

Allow me to set up some context, as I'm sure the title alone makes me look like quite the asshole. I'm a 14 year old girl, and my grandparents have custody of me due to my mom's addiction struggles. My grandparents argue all the time. My grandfather has dementia and is often very rude towards me and my grandmother, calling us slurs, cussing us out, basically a man child. (abuse is a strong word, which I know as I have endured genuine abuse, so I will not describe my grandfather as abusive, just kind of a dick.) My grandmother, on the other hand, has lung cancer. Keep in mind, as asshole-ish as this is of me to say, it's no one's fault but her own. As probably expected, it was caused by cigarette smoking, she's had lung cancer before, and it wasn't looking great at all, but she miraculously beat it. Insisted that was a sign from God and she would live life to a full potential from now on. Two months in I caught her smoking again. She went for a check-in and they saw cancer again. Every aspect of my life is taking care of my grandpa with his dementia and my grandma with her cancer, I mean, they even started homeschooling me so I could focus on them. Of course, I wouldn't mind helping out, but I mean, like, I'm their personal caretaker. Change grandpa's diapers, help them shower, cook every meal, also do everything regarding the family dog, etc. It's been like this for a little less than a year now. Anyway, my 15th birthday is Saturday, April fifth. We didn't do anything for Christmas or Easter, which both used to be a big deal in our house, and next year my birthday IS Easter day, so I'll spend it in church with my aunt. I was very very excited to have a semi-about me day Saturday, knowing I'd at the very least get a cake (even if I had to pay for it) but that won't be happening, I learned today that I will be spending it in chemotherapy with my grandma. I screamed at her. I called her the nastiest names in the book, told her it's not my job to take care of her, that it's her own fault she's even going to chemotherapy for continuing to smoke even after a close call with lung cancer before, that I shouldn't have to be there for her chemo, and even that I wanted a ""normal"" life and would prefer living with my tweaker mother because ""at least I could have school and friends."" My grandma is crying her eyes out and refuses to talk to me, and my grandpa is talking about how much he wants to shoot me (empty threats but still) I know that I was very harsh, and some of the remarks I made were uncalled for, but am I 100% the asshole??

650,1jq4j6z,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my best friend she's a bully?,"WARNING: bullying, racism, homophobia, and ED's mentioned. My best friend (16F) and I (17F) have known each other since kindergarten. we have of course fallen out a few times especially during covid because we couldn't see each other but we became extremely close when we entered high school. I would like to note that we live in a very conservative and closed-minded area, so this next part is not out of the normal per say.

I figured out that I was gay in 9th grade. I am an only child and keep to myself a lot so coming out was probably the hardest thing I have ever done. My best friend was probably one of the last people I came out too because we were so close I was scared that she would see me different and stop being friends with me. When I came out to her, she hugged me, and out bond became stronger. we went into 11th grade, and she started changing. I switched schools for 10th grade but ended up going back to my original high school due to me developing an ED caused by fat shaming. when I transferred back, I would hear her call one of her darker skinned friend's racist slurs. I feel very strongly about this topic and told my best friend that I did not feel comfortable hearing what she was saying and politely asked her to stop. Even if she didn't agree with me, I asked her to at least refrain from saying hateful comments and slurs around me because it made me extremely uncomfortable. She did not. She then moved onto calling me homophobic slurs and telling me it was just a joke. Then I noticed she started bullying others at our school. she even got one of the students suspended because she made up a story that he touched her. The day after that happened, she confidently told me that she made the whole thing up just to get him suspended because she didn't like him. We are in 12th grade now and it has gotten to the point that no one is friends with her anymore. I would consider myself an empathetic person and I'm honestly only friends with her because I am the only one that will hang out with her. I have tried to confront her about her behavior before saying she's a bully and she doesn't believe me. I have gone to the guidance counselor, and she says that it's just normal teenage girl behavior. AITA for calling out my best friend for her actions?"
651,1jq48c6,Asshole,AITAH for rejecting a “We need to talk”,"I (22f) am renting a bedroom from (32m)

I have very severe ptsd and I had a really bad flare up recently that has made it difficult for me to take care of myself, my work and household chores (despite being a workaholic and clean freak). 

Last night I had gotten out of a really intense therapy session. Since Im trying to get back to normal as soon as possible I pushed myself hard enough to cause a panic attack. When these happen I may start screaming/hyperventilating/vomiting uncontrollably for hours until I pass out. I hate it. Our neighbors hate it. My roommate hates it. No one wants that. My number one priority is to not put my Roommate and neighbors through that everything else is secondary.

The good news is that I have skills that help me not do that. While doing my Distress Tolerance skills- I saw my roommate message me that food was done. I can’t stomach anything and he yells at me for not responding quickly. I have to respond “Im sorry I just got out of therapy. Im not gonna eat for a little bit” and he responds “K we need to talk at some point”

That is an extra anxiety that prevents me from calming down. An easy fix would be knowing why“we need to talk.”

So I asked- but it just lead to an unproductive back and forth where I keep explaining that I need to at least know if I did something wrong and he just side steps the questions

Now- I can no longer reliably cope and manage the panic. I am in full survival mode, and the talk he wants is not going to be possible today anymore. “I don’t think Im going to be ready today”

He responds to that telling me to wash my dishes or he was going to kick me out. (Which idk why he couldn’t say that when I literally asked him) 

Usually I wouldn’t respond since- he was obviously not in a good headspace either. However if I ignored him he would start screaming through my door. Again my priority is to not go into a panic attack and Him screaming at me is going to put me in a panic attack.

I tired to communicate that I am in a crisis right now and that I need some time to calm down, but I can and will wash the dishes. I want to cooperate- don’t worry about them, it will be done. I keep repeating myself.

He keeps responding with a bunch of “I don’t care”s, and “thats not good enough” He then starts screaming through the door- and I had a full panic attack.

Now I am getting kicked out because of how pissed off he is about this conversation and the panic attack. From my perspective I genuinely dont know what else I was supposed to do.

Without explaining the context I showed my friend (29m) the texts and he says I was TAH because I was inconsiderate towards my roommates feelings. He believes that if my roommate needed to talk- it’s likely very important and urgent. And it should have taken priority.

I was taught that you need to be calm before addressing important conversations. But is he right? AITAH for asking for this conversation and the dishes to be delayed?

NOTES- This has been edited heavily to remove biased emotional rambles about how I felt. Keep in mind some comments are responding to that version not this one
— I washed my dishes as soon as I was functional. They just would have been done way earlier if I didn’t have a panic attack. 
— I do not have family or a support system. I wouldn’t be living like this or paying rent if I had a choice. 
— I do not medically qualify for inpatient care. That will apparently make my condition worse."
652,1jq3lm9,Not the A-hole,AITA Can I play music in an apartment with thin walls?,"This morning I was playing music at a normal volume while getting ready for work and heard my upstairs neighbor stomping on the ground, and when I stopped my music he stopped... I'm not entirely sure if that was him trying to tell me to shut it off or if he was just like moving furniture, but he's complained to the landlord about me twice before and if he does it again I'm probably gonna be in trouble with the Board of Education (my employer who arranged my housing for me). This guy even talked about considering moving out because of it, and the BoE told me if that happens we will have a ""compensation problem"".

Before, I understood it. I was having friends over and we weren't as quiet as we could've been, sometimes on work nights, and so I stopped having guests over entirely because of it. I don't know what I should do, I really don't feel like it's reasonable that I shouldn't be able to listen to music or watch tv in my own apartment. Now I feel kinda paranoid. Everything I play is at a volume where if I walk to the kitchen 10 feet away I can't really hear it anymore. Should I really just use headphones for everything now?"
653,1jq3gqh,Not enough info,AITA for being this distant from my family?,"I (33F) have been feeling frustrated at my family for being passive aggressive towards me.

I admit I’ve been distant ever since there was a conflict that happened between my partner (living together 7 years, together for 18) and them. Long story short, he does not feel welcome, my family have said some hurtful things, and he’s not willing to be around them without talking things out. They’ve decided he’s the bad guy but he’s “still welcome at their house.” Attempts have been made by my partner to fix things but no compromise. Early on when I would visit my family alone, I would be lectured about how we’re wrong and often felt gaslit so quality time with them hasn’t been great either.

They clearly desire more time with me, don’t really seem to care about having time with my partner, which is hurtful to both of us, but I still do make an effort to see at least my parents  at least once a month.

Because of this, they’ve been very passive aggressive when trying to plan family outings. They talk about wanting to plan things and once everyone agrees to it, they put it on me, literally “you’re in charge,” to get everyone’s schedules and pick an activity because I’m “the one that’s always busy.”

AITA for not making more of an effort? Should I  take on that responsibility even though quality time with my family is complicated? Are my boundaries appropriate?"
654,1jq2nid,Not the A-hole,"AITA for insisting that my sole provider payment of a $350,000 mortgage counts as a business expense for my wife’s home business?","AITA for stating that paying the mortgage counts as my contribution to organization of my wife’s business?

Hello all. I’m married to a wife I love dearly, but wow we don’t get along on most things. One of them is the situation with our basement.

I’m the sole provider—or at least the primary provider. (I provide at least 90% of our money.) She is a very good stay at home mother. She is also an aspiring business owner, and is finally starting to get it off the ground. She resells little trinkets and assorted goodies on Poshmark.

The issue is that the inventory takes up a LOT of space. It takes up so much space, that when we were in our starter home, it was a constant fight over her buying more inventory but not having anywhere to go with it.

I recently got a massive promotion, and a huge upgraded house. It has over 2,000 square feet, BEFORE counting the expansive open basement. It’s $350,000, and the monthly payment is $2,500. One reason we got it was so she could essentially have a warehouse where she lives. As the primary breadwinner, I pay for this entirely alone. We’re both on the property deed, but only I’m on the mortgage. I also pay for all other life necessities, to include the insurance, gas, and maintenance for three cars, and private tuition for our kids. Due to our quality of life, despite me pulling over $130,000 annual, we are still living paycheck to paycheck. I insist that a house this large is a large luxury—I grew up happy in a much smaller house, though she grew up in a house about this size.

Her business is starting to take off, and she finally has the money to pay one employee regularly. She’s paying this employee-friend to regularly help her organize the massive quantities of inventory that have been unorganized. She takes up over half the basement for her inventory alone, and another quarter for hundreds of gallons of stuff that none of us ever use but she refuses to get rid of. All of my things fit into one quarter of the basement, which I have immaculately organized, mostly because I just don’t have much.

Point is, basement needs organization, and not my one quarter—it’s her three quarters. Full of her stuff. I think I pay enough by paying the mortgage, and that she should have to pay for help if she needs help with those mountains of business inventory and just “things” she refuses to either use or dispose of. She says I’m unfair, and contributing nothing since I pay nothing to the helper.

She believes I’m not contributing to the organization because I have yet to pay a dollar to her employee-friend. She also insists that me paying the mortgage alone doesn’t count as helping with the business, because she refuses to see a house this large as a luxury and instead thinks I’m holding the necessity of family housing over her head. Am I the asshole for insisting that paying this mortgage is a luxury I provide her for her business?"
655,1jq2emi,Asshole,AITA for believing that paying for my boyfriend's order isn't the same as when he does it for me since he makes up for 80-90% of the bill ?,"I, (25F), been together with boyfriend (35M) for 9 months now (8 to be precise since we broke up late  January and got back together early March). So, my boyfriend is an overspending person and like a friend of his described him ""he can't walk for 5 minutes straight without spending money"".

When we go out for our regular casual dates to simple cafeterias, bars or pubs, I don't spend more than 5-6€ (enough in my country to get a coffee/drink/food) and I'm happy with my order, I don't need more. He gets to spend around 30€ every time and sometimes he offered to pay mine. I was never used to that with my friends, we always paid each for our own order, end of story. Boyfriend insisted to pay sometimes and he said ""it'll be on you another time"". Case is, I'm neither willing nor in a position to cover his expenses since I'm currently a Master's student and not working in order to follow the classes, I'm using my parents money.

Recently we've been out together a lot and I observed that I paid all of our last dates. Luckily we didn't go out drinking but we went at the bowling center and played various games there and instead of paying half half I ended up paying for everything. It was 20€ in total, which is a lot for me and I'm questioning why didn't he think of paying half ? We went there again yesterday because he insisted to do so, I didn't want to because I had spent another 40€ in just a day for his drinks before. 60€ for just 2 simple dates is insane for me! And I paid again! He did as well, but I paid more than him and he didn't even think of asking me to pay something just by himself. He spent a shit ton on drinks as well.

AITA to believe that me paying 30 and 40€ for both of us is unfair since he always makes up for 90% of the bill ? When he spends that amount of money it ain't the same since I only make up for 5€ in total every time. Oh and another example, we went to the cinema once and I paid for both of our tickets, he asked me to do so, I thought each one of us would pay ours (so 14€ in total, double than what I had in mind) and he ended up spending 30€ on food and drinks at the cinema alone for himself (to be clear he obviously gives me if I want to, but I don't, if I wanted something I'd get it myself).

This whole thing is hurting my pockets and thinking that it's my parents money hurts me more."
656,1jq1vdn,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to “help” my friend?,"So my friend has gotten into a relationship, and has been telling me about negative things that happen in said relationship. Ive been helping her giving, my advice but its always been ignored. The dude she is with has been honestly treating her like shit (Atleast from what she has told me). Ive told her numerous time that she should leave him as he obviously doesn’t respect her, or atleast call him out on his bs. However she has done none of these things and continues to complain to me about things that he is doing and asks me “What should i do?” everyday. I dont mind her coming to me but when she ignores everything I tell her it just gets to a point where my input is useless. 

I eventually called her out on her bs, and told her the she either needs to start actually considering my advice, or that im just going to no longer say my piece on her situationship anymore. Then she starts to bring up stuff from past relationships and talking stages, and says that “I have no room to judge” (Mind you im not judging her, im just telling her the truth). 

Honestly i really do wanna help but im tired of getting attacked and reminded of times where i was being i guess “delusional”.

So AITA?

657,1jq0sth,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my friend to quit our choir?,"So I (18f) and my friend ""Liz"" (18f) are currently in the school choir. Our first year choir director a retired during Covid and a new, younger, music teacher started. When the choir started back up, she (Lilian) was the new director. 

A lot of people don't like Lilian. I think she's fine, she's not the best music teacher I've ever had but she's good enough at her job, and as a choir director, she doesn't keep as much attention and respect from students that the old teacher did but we do alright. We won the choir concert our school enters every year under her directorship two years ago and did decently well in it last year. 

All this to say, Liz was complaining to our friends the other day about the choir. Direct quotes include ""the choir is so shit"" ""it's gotten so much worse"" ""we actually sound so bad, I'm embarassed"" 

She's been consistently complaining about how much she dislikes Lilian and thinks the choir has gone so downhill since she took over and that the other singers aren't great for literally a year at this point and I just snapped this time. 

I turned to her and said ""if you think the choirs so bad, literally just leave it. We won (competition) by a mile the other year."" I'm just so sick and tired of her saying the choir is shit, while I, her friend, and some lf our other friends are in this choir. She might not be insulting me personally but who wants to hear that about a choir they love and participate in? 

She got snappy back at me and said ""I can't leave now bc Lilian's roped me into the solo group"", as our song atm and has a part that a group of six of us are performing. I said to her ""you've been in the choir for two years and complained the whole time"" and she got up and left. 

Today Lilian told me there was an extra practice for the solo group and I went to find Liz to tell her.  She just shoved straight past me and said ""yeah, I KNOW"" and hasn't talked to me the rest of the day. 

Our friends are kinda staying out of it bc only a couple of them are actually in the choir or have Lilian as a teacher, so I'm not sure what everyone thinks of what I said. 

I know I wasn't the nicest about it, but if she hates the choir so much then I think she should just leave and stop making it everyone else's problem, bc the rest of us do actually enjoy choir and I hate hearing her say we're bad, and we're shit and all the rest of it. 
AITA here?"
658,1jq07q3,Not the A-hole,AITA for Telling My Girlfriend to Stop Spamming Me with Calls and Messages After I Went Silent for a Few Hours?,"After having supper at 6 PM, I left for a school group discussion. Since we weren’t actively talking at the time, I didn’t inform my girlfriend. To focus, I put my phone on flight mode.

Two hours later, I turned my phone back on and saw multiple missed calls and messages across different platforms—email, Snapchat, WhatsApp, and Instagram—all from her asking where I was and why I had disappeared.

This has happened before. I’ve told her to limit her calls to twice and not spam me with messages, but she continues to do it. I told her to stop, explaining that I don’t want to be treated like I’m in danger just because I don’t respond for a few hours.

She said she was just worried and didn't take it lightly that I told her to stop, but I think this level of response is unnecessary. AITA for telling her to stop?

659,1jq03wh,Asshole,AITA for chasing someone down to stop letting their dog use my yard as a bathroom?,"I've (35M) got a freshly remodeled front yard that looks really good. Its about a month old. 
[Think something similar to this.](https://www.needforbuild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Landscape-Design-Landscape-Design-Clairemont-CA-Need-For-Build-Inc-768x576.jpg)

Our old front yard was a grass yard.  We regularly had issues with people letting their pets shit and piss.  Shit was mostly picked up, but our yard reeked of piss when it was hot out.  I put up a ""be respectful no poop or pee signs"", they are still up post remodel. 

 
Finally, my wife and I bit the bullet to remodel the yard.  Now the first 5 feet of the yard next to the sidewalk is rock, and we were hoping that would deter people from letting their dog in our yard.  It doesn't seem like it has.  It is still a noticeable issue to our noses. 
 
This morning, my wife (27F) pointed out someone (30's F) letting their dog go to the bathroom in our yard.  As soon as I saw this I headed for the door and by the time I got outside she was in front of my neighbors yard. I walked her way and yelled at her not to let her dog piss and shit in my yard. 

I pointed out the signs.  She said if her dog has to go, her dog has to go.  She says, i don't know why you are complaining, I cleaned it up.  I was like, ""Not the Piss"".  She was giving me big attitude.  I yelled at her to teach her dog to piss and shit at home.  She told me ""shut up asshole"" and called me a bully.  As she continued walking away I said my yard is not for your dog.  AITA?"

This is because my Freind keeps sending me YouTube short links and spamming me asking if I found it funny. This usually wakes me because I have my phone set up to chime after a few spammed messages because I've had issues with not waking up during a potential fire at my aunts apartment(some dumb kid pulled the alarm) so this causes me to wake and, I just see my Freind sent me the billionth gojo edit and telling me it's so real. So recently I've been feeling shit in the morning because I lack sleep after I'm woken. I decided to tell him to stop spamming at night when I'm trying to sleep but he said just turn on do not disturb. I explained why I can't then he said and I quote ""Just don't do the drug I give you."" That's like telling a crack addict not to do the crack you just gave them. They put me on do not disturb because ""your being childish""

661,1jpzyqy,Not the A-hole,AITA for buzzing my hair without asking my mother,"I made a new account to do this because i dont want my friends on my other accounts to worry. i 19f and my mother 42f (at least i think she is 42 sorry about that) dont really have the best relationship and honestly now its come to a head. I had always had a large afro...until i was put in military school, a temporary facility, and a residential facility then my hair started falling out. Since then i did my best to get it back but it really did. I eventually got an undercut which as some of you may know can become quite ugly when it grows out. So with my ugly growing undercut and the Oklahoma heat i wanted to buzz my hair. I did. I told my oldest brother 23m because it was his clippers i used then told my mom. I had told her i wanted it short about a week ago which she forgot so i showed her. Its of course patchy but its better than ubering across town and paying to get it done.

She asked me if i was trying to do something with myself or whatever kids these days do (still got no clue what she is talking about or trying to ask) and then told me it didnt make sense i could ask to hang with my "" Raggedy friends"" but not ask about important stuff. I told her my hair wasnt important and i ask her out of respect as i could simply just leave and do stuff without asking just as i cut my hair without asking but i dont because it wouldnt be right for me to up and leace without asking.

She told me i have 30 days to find a job and make money to live on my own. Ive applied for 50+ jobs and she has taken me to 2 interviews so it seems pretty clear i wont make it that time frame so homelessness seems to be the next option for me (making it round three of me living on the streets) 

Idk. Should i have just asked? Should i have bit the bullet and kept dealing with my 3/4 permed ugly under cut hair? In my mind im only 19 i know it'll grow back and for a chunk of my childhood she had short hair (that was styled not a buzzcut cut but it was still short) idk.

AITA for buzzing my hair without asking my mom?"

It's a smallish town and there are like 4 bars, all do Karaoke. I was at Karaoke Friday and end up at a table with said ex friend, we will call Sam. Now I'm not one to stir up shit usually, but what caused our falling out was because I yelled at another friend (35m) who had been fucking with me/there was a rumor that he was cheating with her on his brother (she is my friends now ex girlfriend). Now I was in the wrong are stating some of the shit i did because I should have just stuck to my shit, 100 percent gonna own that. I would/have apologized for that. But she turned around and threatened the shit out of me. To the point where I literally just blocked her on everything and moved on. She has never spoken to me about it, and every time I see her she pretends we are cool. I'm not rude or anything, but not very friend either. Basically you say hi or we are with a group of friends I'm not gonna be shitty. Anyhow, enough background. We ended up at a table while I was waiting for my Uber playing blackjack and she is across from me. She finally looks at me and goes are we cool? I straight up just look her dead in her face and say No. Because we aren't and im not going to pretend otherwise. She seemed to get upset and my Uber shows up like two seconds later and I just leave. I was drinking and while not fall down drunk I was past buzzed. I didn't realize to the next morning it was kinda completely dickish, and now how I usually act at all. Am I the asshole?"

WIBTA if I didn't purchase a gift for this shower?  I have zero intentions of attending and will sign the card that's going to be passed around.

I think forcing coworkers to buy baby gifts is a shitty thing to do, but that's not why I don't want to.  I don't know this guy or his partner at all.  I wish them well but the whole situation makes me very uncomfortable.  At the same time, I don't want to be an asshole at my new job."
664,1jpz5rv,Not the A-hole,AITA for opening up my husbands mortgage letters?,"AITA for opening up a letter from my husband’s mortgage lender? He bought the house before we were married, and due to my credit at the time I couldn’t be on the loan. Plus we had only been dating for close to 2 years. We’ve been best friends for a decade and married for a few years. 

I contribute all of my paycheck to our shared bills, but he makes 3 times as much as I do. We were doing weekly budget dates until he fully went into sales. After that, his paychecks were large enough that I would just send my part and he said he’d take care of any payments. During that time we went on numerous vacations and even adopted families for Christmas that were affected by a natural disaster. Spending money left and right. 

Skip to 02/2025, and I finally opened a letter since we were getting so many. Every time one would come in, he would say he paid for it and not to worry. I don’t pry, but the volume of letters we were receiving was astronomical. I opened the letter to find out we haven’t had a payment go through since September of 2024. He said it wasn’t right and that he’d call. Two weeks later I asked again, he said he did call and they said it was taken care of. 

Next thing you know we’re getting certified mail that we are heading towards foreclosure. At this point we’re 7 months behind on payments and we qualified for a lien instead of foreclosure. Something to celebrate in comparison to losing our home.

Jumping ahead… I didn’t yell, I definitely cried but I just said he was smarter than that. How could he not see the money not coming out? Or not seeing any type of confirmation? Anytime I brought up our bills he’d just say it was taken care of. 

Well, apparently I’m not allowed to be mad at the situation. That it was taken care of now and he will pay back the lien and I can’t mention it without him getting offended. I’m not even mad about the payments, shoot I have ADHD and this is something I could have done in my past. I’m angry about the lying. AITA for wanting an apology? I feel like I’ve been extremely supportive while holding him accountable but am I being too harsh? "
665,1jpyvpf,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting something done.,"Alright so I'm married and lately my wife has been yelling just about every time she's awake. Sometimes I feel like she's even yelling at me in her sleep. Anyways, she doesn't have a job cause she lost it by being late and has lost other jobs before for the same reason and blames it on mental health. She's had about 4 or 5 jobs in the past year while I've been at the same one for the last 2 years. She sleeps in until like 1 in the afternoon and when I get home she's always still in pajamas and laying on the couch with nothing done. 

Here's the thing that just happened. I'm in a band I won't name the name of but we do rehearsals at the house once a week. I've been working a lot lately and the rehearsal rooms been pretty dirty and I had the day off it's Wednesday so i decided to clean it and vacuum it before the boys got here on Thursday. Now this happens so much so that I already knew as soon as I started the vaccum she was gonna get off the couch to come yell at me about how I should be cleaning something that benefits her and sure enough as soon as I turned the vacuum off she came down to yell at me about how I should be cleaning the basement instead or doing the dishes. I said to her that I have been working all week and have people coming over who need to utilize this room and that the basement isn't an absolutely necessary space to be cleaned and that I'll clean it when I'm available to clean it and there's nothing else going on. We don't have a garage or a shed so everything kinda goes down there and there's not enough shelves. She threatened that if I don't clean it up right now that while I'm at work tomorrow she's going to take all the stuff from down there and throw it all in the rehearsal room that I had just about finished cleaning. I told her she needed to stop yelling at me that I'm tired of her yelling at me all the time. Lately she hasn't even been intimate with me I've had to ask her for 3 weeks now and every single time she comes up with some sort of your typical response of I'm too tired or I'm too hungry or I'm too stressed out even tho while I was at work for 10 hours cutting down trees she just got 12 hours of sleep and then sat on the couch watching tv and drinking a latte until I got home and she doesn't even get up to come welcome me at the door and instead finds something else to yell at me about. I've tried to get her to go to counseling and she refuses to and i just don't know what to do I don't want to leave her because I love her but deep down I kinda feel like I'm being abused. It's so hard not to yell back and not to argue with her but it just seems like it's all I have left in me just this deep sadness and anger towards the situation "
666,1jpy8r9,Not the A-hole,AITA: For telling my stepfather he will not be apart of my future?,"My stepfather (m51) and I (f19) have not had a necessarily good relationship even before he married my mother, we tolerate each other considering we have one thing in common; my mother/his wife being an important part of our lives. I have lived with my mother,stepfather and sibling since I was 16. He has very specific rules of living in his house, which I follow, I also pay rent now because that just makes sense since I’m an adult. These rules since I was 16 have gotten really strict over the years to the point he argues with me over the littlest mistakes I do, that is fine but these days he tries to find anything to argue with me about not just rules. He starts the arguments when he knows I’m the only one in the house, or if my mother is not around. I tend to just stay in my room, cook food when he’s not home or just stay out studying or at a friend’s house to avoid conflict. His native language and mine are not the same, the language here is my second one so I don’t like arguing since I can’t express myself well. 

The arguments have been happening more frequently to the point he does it in front of my mother too. I can tell she is uncomfortable seeing it, but doesn’t add to the situation because she doesn’t want to pick sides. He uses the language against me while arguing, telling me not to speak my native language in the house either wether to my mother when I don’t know a word in the language spoken here or when I’m calling my dad since he only speaks our native language. This coupled with other things happening has put me on edge. 

I work and study. Last week I was getting ready for work; a late shift and only my stepfather was home, I was putting my things in my bag and he came over to start an argument over catching my mother and I having talked in my native language the day before. He argued that we should not speak in a language he doesn’t know because we could be talking bad about him, we weren’t talking about him but about how I wanted to change work places, same company different town, but he didn’t believe me. We even switched languages to his when he came into the living room when it happened.The argument got heated and words were thrown around on both sides, he said something very left field that he knew I didn’t like discussing (a traumatic time when I 15) I was so angry I said he now had no place in my future, my future wedding he wouldn’t attend but my mother could, my future children he wouldn’t be a grandfather to but my mother would be a grandma. He told my mother, who for the last week has been tiptoeing around it, I feel bad for her as she is caught in the middle of this and apologised to her, and I know I’d been way too harsh on my stepfather but I don’t want my future to be filled with more argument especially not on special things like a possible wedding or kids. I will be moving out soon since that’s been my plan the last few months, I finally found an affordable apartment and maybe that will relieve some tension. "
667,1jpxzgl,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting frustrated with my downstairs neighbors who keep complaining about *every* little noise?,"I (21, F) live in a 4-bed flat on the 2nd and 3rd floors with three flatmates, all of us students. Since we moved in, we’ve had ongoing complaints from the tenants living below us. At first, it seemed like a minor issue, but it’s escalated to a point where it’s becoming ridiculous, and I’m starting to feel like we’re being harassed.

The complaints didn’t start over loud music or parties (which, by the way, we’re all very mindful of since we’re students and know how annoying noisy neighbors can be). Instead, it was about *walking around*. Yes, apparently the way we move around the flat is bothering them. They first contacted our letting agency, who passed the complaints on to us and told us that there was nothing they could do and that we should try and handle it ourselves. So we did. We gave them my number, so they could reach out if there was an issue.

Here’s the thing:  oncewe realized that they weren’t complaining about late-night noise or loud talking — and that it was about our normal movements around the flat, we’ve taken several steps to accommodate them: we fixed our doors so they close really slowly (so they don’t slam), we’ve been walking on our tiptoes everywhere, and we make a conscious effort to be extra quiet. If something accidentally falls on the floor, our instinctive reaction is to worry if we’ve bothered them. 

But, they’re still complaining, and it’s starting to feel like harassment. Every time we even *slightly* move around, they text me or my flatmates. It got to a point where another person in our flat’s number gets passed on when the person they’ve been texting gets mentally drained by the extent of their complaints.

At this point, it feels like no matter what we do, it won’t be enough for them. I’m starting to feel like we’re living under a microscope, and it’s draining. We’ve tried to be polite, but we’re all getting frustrated because it’s clear that no matter what we do, we’re always going to be a problem for them. So we’re seriously considering giving up on accommodating their every complaint.

So, AITA for getting annoyed and starting to feel like we can’t do anything without being constantly criticized by our neighbors? "
668,1jpxxgf,Not the A-hole,AITA for not staying overnight at the hospital with our 7 year old son along with my extra wife?,"Update below:

Our son has a bad case of pneumonia requiring a surgical procedure to drain fluid from his chest and now he has a chest tube. The infection is pretty bad, we’ve been here about 8 days and he is finally starting to turn a corner. The fevers are less frequent and not as high. 

I have been here everyday and will continue to do so. His mom, my ex wife, is also here but during the day she’s working (remotely) and a little more distracted. 

A couple days ago, with our son showing some progress, I decided to leave for the night so I can get some rest. His mom will leave for about 3 hours in the late afternoon/evening to shower, change, do whatever, and when she returns I leave. At that time our son is getting ready to sleep or is sleeping. 

I return first thing in the morning, between 6 and 6:30am to make sure I am here for the Dr. rounds or any early morning procedure such as labs or X-rays. 

Full transparency, my girlfriend lives near by and I go to her house to shower, change, and get some rest in a real bed. 

I’ve offered my son’s mom the same opportunity, I’ve told her that if she wanted to go home for the night I am more than happy to stay. However, she refuses and today when I made the same offer she said no, she’s going to stay with our son and doesn’t understand how any parent can leave their child at the hospital so they can go be with their partner. 

Apparently she can still get in my head because here I am asking if I am the asshole for leaving my son at the hospital with his mom, my ex wife, instead of staying the night. Should I also be staying if she’s here? 

Typo: It is Ex-wife not extra wife, although I’m glad I didn’t catch it because the extra wife comments gave me a much needed laugh, thank you. 

Update: first of all, I want to thank you all for your well wishes, it truly means a lot!  

We are still at the hospital but my son is doing much better. Chest tube is schedule to come out tomorrow, he is responding well to new antibiotics, appetite is back, and fevers have been gone for over 48 hours, thank god!

I continue to offer my son’s mom to go home for the night but she continues to refuse. However, she is taking longer breaks during the day and it seems like she is getting some rest because she comes back looking more refreshed. 

Since she insists on staying, I continue to leave for a few hours at night to get some sleep. However, I am back first thing in the morning before they wake and to make sure I don’t  miss any procedure, labs, x-ray, CT scan or any dr. Rounds, which I haven’t, and I stay until my son falls asleep. His mom is better about me leaving, I think because she sees how present and involved I am in our son’s care, treatment, and treatment plan. So she stopped with the Petty comments, for now, or she found this thread lol. 

All this has taught me a valuable lesson, we hear about it all the time but this experience really made me believe it. We cannot take care of other people if we don’t take care of ourselves. I feel more present and clear headed compared to the first few nights where I was staying all night. I am a bigger guy so the tiny bed plus the frequent nurse check-ins make it impossible to get any rest. I was miserable during the day and was running on fumes, or adrenaline since our son was in the thick of it. Thankfully he’s in a much more stable place. 

It really is whatever works for you. This is working for me and I am ok with it. I get be present all day with my son, stay engaged in his treatment, and he seems to know that I am here for him, as well as his mom. 

Side note: therapy has been good for me in learning that I needed to stop seeking validation from others and learn and work at looking for validation from within. Still working on that and I have grown so much in that department everywhere else in my life. I learned, though, that my son’s mom still knows what strings to pull to make me compromise that part of my mental wellbeing. Although this thread provided some validation, thank you, it was also a big reminder that the validation I truly need is within me. I know I’m doing right by my son, and I also know that I need to take care of myself so my son gets the best possible version of me."
669,1jpwysr,Not the A-hole,AITA for offering my clothes to a coworker after losing weight?,"I have a coworker that I am very close to and we eat lunch together, etc. I’m a clothes horse and I have so many things that I’ve never worn and still have the tags on. My coworker is always commenting to me that she loves my clothes and if I ever decide to give anything away, please come to her first!  We were the same size. 

I recently lost a lot of weight and I’ve gone down five sizes. I’ve been working really hard at it, but I haven’t been talking about it that much because it seems to be a bit of tension between the two of us. She’s never said anything outright, just some passive aggressive comments about how I’m getting too thin. I just ignore it because a lot of people say that, and I think it’s just a result of the shock of me losing weight. I still have about 30 pounds to lose before I even hit the 150 mark and I’m very short. I’m definitely not too thin and I still suffer from body dysmorphia, so I don’t even think I’m thin at all. 

I recently went through my clothes, and I have a shocking amount of things that have either never been worn or have been worn once (I really need to work on this addiction). I put them together in boxes and on my next trip into the office, I asked her if she would like me to bring those in so she could go through them. Her face took on this very shocked expression, and then she said “why would you ask me that? Why would you insult me by asking me if I want your hand me downs and castoffs? That’s so humiliating.”  I was stunned and I think I might’ve actually said I was sorry and walked away.   

To make things even worse, there’s another friend in the office who was also my size, and as we went out to the car later that day she asked me what the boxes were in my car. I told her they were my larger size clothes and that I had brought them for our other coworker, but she didn’t want them (I didn’t go into any details).  She went nuts and asked if she could go through the box. She called her daughter who worked very close by and we spent the next 45 minutes going through the boxes and getting the stuff that she wanted. They literally took almost everything. While they were doing it, the other coworker came outside to leave for the day and saw what was happening. She got into her car and left.  Later that night she texted me and lit into me about me giving the clothes to the other coworker.  

I am so confused. Did I insult her? And if I did, why would she care if I gave the clothes to someone else? After several years of a good work friendship, she won’t even speak to me anymore. Am I the asshole? 

EDIT:  Just as an FYI, we have been friends and coworkers for six years. I have been giving her clothes off and on for those six years. Some of the comments suggested that I put this in the original post. During those six years, I have lost 10 or 15 pounds and given her some of those clothes during that time and she didn’t seem offended. I’m now down 65 pounds.  

UPDATE: She called me earlier today and totally lit into me. She said that I should’ve understood that she was sensitive about my weight loss because she felt like I was losing weight “to show her up.“ I told her that I didn’t know what she meant by that because I’ve been losing weight because of my blood pressure and because I was prediabetic. My doctor was worried that I would have a heart attack if I continued at this size. She said that was a bunch of shit and that I’ve been losing weight to make her the fattest person in the office. I basically sighed and was ready to give up, when she said “oh, and how dare you give all those clothes to XxxxxX? She’s going to be wearing those clothes in the office and I have to see her in them when you were supposed to give them to me!“ When I said that she said that was humiliating and that she didn’t want my hand me downs, she hung up on me. I honestly have no idea what to do at this point. I want to apologize but now I’m not sure I should now. I don’t feel that I can do anything at this point. "
670,1jpvut0,Not the A-hole,AITAH for being pissed about his April Fools joke?,"Edit: this was my husband’s idea. The 13 year old just went along.

Yesterday driving home with my 5 kids while my husband is away (he’s driving long-haul this week).

13 year old: dad was in an accident, he’s been trying to call you, but it won’t go through. He’s okay though. (we’ve been having problems with our phones)

Me: you’re messing with me.

13 y.o.: no I’m not.

Long pause

Me: seriously are you messing with me?

13 y.o.: no. He was in an accident, but he’s okay.

Call my husband in a panic, knowing that he always says he’s okay when he’s not

Me, still driving a van full of kids: you were in an accident?!

Husband: babe, it’s April fools

I hung up on him and had a mini-meltdown.

I felt physically ill. Got all sweaty, and then my 13 y.o. noticed I was crying and repeatedly apologized.

My husband later gave me an apology (“I’m sorry” via text). When I tried to explain this morning that I’m still upset that he sent me into a panic for fun, he responded that he figured I’d see through it since it was April fools.

I’m pissed and feel like my trust has been broken. Am I the asshole for thinking this was too far, and wanting a real apology?"
671,1jpv927,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my friend borrow my car after she crashed hers?,"So my friend recently totaled her car (her fault, she admitted it). She asked to borrow mine for a few weeks until she figures things out. I told her no because I can’t afford anything happening to mine—I need it for work and errands, and I don’t want to deal with the stress of “what ifs.” Now she’s upset and says I’m not being a real friend. AITA?"
672,1jpv7vp,Asshole,AITA for not making the dinner that my husband requested?,"My (28f) husband (31m) and I have been married for a little over two years. I'm currently about 2 months pregnant with our first child.

My husband works as the general manager of a local fast food franchise. I'm not under employment anywhere, but I do a lot of freelance technical writing work from home.

My husband's position pays surprisingly well with good benefits, but he's been having to put in a ton of hours lately, as staffing has been a major problem.

The other day, he texted me to let me know that he would be working late; AGAIN, for the fourth time this week. A little later, I texted him that I was going grocery shopping and asked if there was anything special he'd like me to pick up while I was there. He responded: ""Get me a couple packs of peach sparkling water, please. Also, I could really use some comfort food. You think I could get some meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and corn?""

I responded with thumbs up and winking, kissing face emojis. I bought him everything he asked for. However, I had already thawed pork chops for dinner that night, and, honestly, they were on the verge of going bad so I had to use them up.

When my husband got home, he asked where his meatloaf was. I told him that I'd bought the ingredients but that I wasn't serving meatloaf that night. He then said that this was the one thing he'd been looking forward to for the past couple of hours, and that I'd made it seem as if I was going to make it for him. I told him that I'd never said any such thing, and that I'm not his domestic servant, taking dinner orders.  He shot back that if I didn't want to make what he asked for that I should have just said so, but I said that all I'd indicated was that I'd pick up the food, not that I'd make his requested meal that evening.

This whole thing could probably be written off as a miscommunication, but, honestly, I'm angry that my husband seems to assume that I'm at his beck and call to make whatever meal he wants. And he's angry that I apparently ""can't do one nice thing for him when he asks."" Who's the AH?

673,1jpv4g9,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I complain about someone who I believe is bullying me?,"Okay so I (18M) am on my last year of Bachillerato (spanish high school) and i've been in my curent school for 3 years. So basically on the first year I managed to make some friends (I was new to the school and they already knew each other) and I kind of made into a cool friendgroup. 

On my second year, a boy who I already knew about returned from studying abroad and I knew he was best friebnds with some of my friends. Well, I tried to be nice to him, talk to him, and I wanted to build a friendship because I thought he was nice, even though a lot of people told me he wasn't.

Well, turns out he disliked me and I eally didn't catch that, and my firends decided that they weren't going to say anything and so we met up several times with bith me and him being in the same space. I tried to keep it cool, but he started to make some passive aggressive comments about my appearance, me being gay and he became a bit aggresive. Even though, I continued with my ""be nice"" act, and sitll invited him to plans and helped him with studying.

Things started evolving negatively. We have a lot of friends in common and he started playing the victim with everything. One day, he smashed my head against a counter and he told everyone I started it. For the sake of my friendships, I still didn't say anything and tolerated everything.

Fast forward to this year, thinks have started to get worse. I am constantly being pushed, mocked and degraded. He even farted on my face once and he has tried to make me fall by pushing me several times. My friends don't intervene in anything. Some weeks ago, he started shouting the name of someone I liked a long time ago in front of everyone (including said boy), and I tried hard not to cry. I have to have lunch with him because I need to go with my friends bc I don't have anyone else.

He's failing almost everything, he is insecure about many things and I know it, and he might have to repeat this year. Everyone thinks of him as a nice guy. This is important in context.

No one sides with me, I told my friend I was planning on doing this and he started to ramble about how I'm overreacting and how I lack empathy and that he's just like this. My school is quite strict about bullying and, since there's only two  weeks left before Holy Week, finals and SAT preparation and since I won't have to have lunch with him anymore, I was thinking on going to the teachers and explaining everything. So WIBTA if I tell on him, possibly getting him suspended and ruining his chances of still being seen as the school's nice guy and breaking my friendships over this?"
674,1jpuuzx,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for telling my younger sis to hide in the closet,"Last night me and my sister went on an errand and she dropped me a ""do you have a crush on a girl?"" on me. I panicked and lied about it. I AM GAY, but my family is not accepting of it, I follow a golden rule of not coming out until I can be independent because my family is crazy religious and they might kick me out and  I cant handle the judgements. 

Then she followed with ""I have a crush on a girl classmate."" I did not expect that at all and panicked and lied even more. I do though have a history of yapping about having a girl crush but joke about it immediately to brush it off. This time though, I said that I am aromantic and only have ""crushes"" in an aromantic way like I just like the way they look. 

After lying to her like this, I felt bad and didn’t know what to do about it. I felt that she was asking for an advice of some sort. 

She’s also religious, so I don’t know how to explain that it is wrong from a religious perspective but not necessarily from a human one. I am torn between telling her the truth and giving her my advice of hiding in the closet for now and to not tell our parents (I know its a bad advice but I dont know what else to say to her) or just letting her handle it by herself. I dont want to hurt her since she is still very young. I genuinely dont know what to do or say that will help her it might become a butterfly effect where I thought I was helping but I actually wasnt. What should I say to her?

675,1jpudpw,Not the A-hole,AITA for threatening to cancel my wedding that my dad is paying for if he invites his brother?,"My Fiancé and I are getting married in May and decided that we didn’t want to have a traditional + large wedding, we had always really wanted to get married at the courthouse. A big reason for this is because we didn’t want to have to deal with the drama that comes along with not inviting people who think they are entitled to be invited (specifically my uncle and his wife). My parents were very upset about the courthouse idea because they wanted more of a celebration, so we compromised and rented a big vacation house to get married at. It wasn’t exactly what we wanted but we were still happy to do it this way. My parents paid for the house. We invited about 10 people, including two couples that my parents are friends with. But now my dad is insisting we invite his brother. I have always felt very strongly about not inviting my dad’s brother and his wife to our wedding, no matter how small our ceremony is. They are extremely entitled people, have spread many false rumors about my family, trash talked us behind our backs, all while trying to maintain the guise of being one big, perfect loving family. Put simply I don’t care how closely related I am to them - I do not have any sort of affection for them and I certainly don’t trust them. 

Now my dad is using the fact that he is paying for everything as a way to control his brother getting invited. He says it’s also a celebration for him too, so he wants his brother there (even tho his will have other friends and family there). I say it’s my wedding day and I don’t want to spend it with someone who has treated us like we’re beneath him his whole life. My Fiancé and I have already compromised for my parents by getting married at this house in the first place, we don’t need to make any more compromises for them. My dad is not budging and is accusing me of being selfish and petty, so now my Fiancé and I are strongly considering canceling it all and going back to our original courthouse plans. Seeing us get married is a privilege, not a right. 

So AITA here? Does my father actually get more say since he is the one paying for everything?

TLDR; Dad is paying for wedding, insists on inviting jerk brother. Fiancé and I want to get privately married at courthouse if he doesn’t budge "
676,1jpu82d,Not the A-hole,AITA for not paying for my friend's brownie,"It was one of my friends' birthday and she invited me to her dorm. I showed up and it was sort of a vibe where everyone bought their own pizzas and ate them. I wasn't feeling too hungry or in the mood to spend money so I just bought a can of Pringles. Everyone instantly took to eating from my can and I did not mind sharing. My friend then offered everyone including me a brownie. I initially politely declined insisting I was fine with the Pringles. Bur when she insisted I gave in and ate one. After the party, she called me up 7 times the next day within a span of an hour asking me to pay for the brownie I ate. I told her I didn't have enough cash and that she'd have to wait but she still kept calling. Finally I got mad. I had a cup noodles worth the same as the brownie and went to her room and gave it to her. 
After this she said I was in the wrong and that she still wanted the money. I refused since she offered the brownie to me on her birthday, after I declined without making it clear I had to pay for it. We never talked after that, but I wonder if I'm in the wrong."
677,1jpsqd1,Not the A-hole,AITAH for doing a rebellious actions against my parents?,"First before i start: English isn’t my first language (it’s my second language, i know i’m bad at it) so you might find the sentence in wrong grammar (i’m sorry about that) 

Me (21F) is having a hard time because of my parents. So short backstory ever since kindergarten to my senior high school life i’ve always followed their rules because i want to gain their “trust.” My destination was always [Home - School - Home] i’ve never hangout with my friends from school neither my friends in my neighborhood. But the trust i wanted, it never happened because of one mistake i did back then when i was a child. 

So now I’m struggling physically and emotionally because when I politely ask them for something for example having to overnight for our thesis/research defense they will automatically say “no.” Even when i have a bf or not, the reason they always said to me is “you guys can do it in the morning or afternoon why do you guys always at night?” Mind you they’re yelling when telling me this, the reason why we do it at night because there’s no noise (we all have noisy neighbors) and we all have something to do at morning and afternoon so we (my groupmates) did it at night 

Here in the country i live i always experience traffic, when i’m not home at the time they expect me to be at home my parents will call me nonstop until i answer their calls and tell them that i’m stuck in traffic (i don’t own any vehicles because i only commute) they won’t even believe me that it was “traffic.” Unless they hear it from somewhere else then they believe me

So now i done things that make them MAD mad like i don’t go home at the exact time and they’re telling me things that doesn’t make sense. To the point i felt like i’m always grounded, they won’t even let me go out to get some fresh air 

So AITAH for being a rebellious child? "
678,1jps1dj,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I asked my boyfriend to not take his bestfriend everywhere?,"I (16f) and my bf (17m) have been together for around 7 months. We are really close and I’m not able to see him a lot outside of school, mostly bc he lives far away and doesn’t have the money for dates and stuff. At school (well and outside of school) he’s always with his Bff (18m). And I get it because I also only have one singular close friend, but the thing is, he brings his bff around everywhere. Whenever me and him want alone time just for a couple hours, his bff has to come. When I plan something fun for us, his bff has to come, when I want to play video games with him, his bff doesn’t play video games but he will stay and try to insert himself in our convos. When it was our 6 months anniversary, I got him a gift (we were both rlly busy with school and wrestling so we decided to go out over the weekend) and invited HIM to sit outside with me so we can exchange the gifts and hang out for maybe 20-30 min before practice. His bff came and kept touching him in front of me, in a way of “oh your boyfriend likes me more than you haha”. I told him about this before and he said that his bff just follows him around even if he just wants to be alone. He said he would try to get to him but his bff is very stubborn. This continues happening and on Monday, I went to see my bf at the park and we were supposed to have a lil picnic. His bff was there. Announced. And I ended up alone. I’m leaving for a vacation on Monday and I really just want quality time with my bf before I leave, but I think his bff is just gonna follow around. (Also I think this is needed info, but him and his bff live in the same apartment area. I don’t want to say complex, because they live directly across eachother. So whenever Bf wants to walk over to the park or somewhere, his bff usually just follows.)

679,1jprq0j,Asshole,AITA: I skip a lot of events for close friends on Sundays because I refuse to do anything.,"This isn’t tied to a specific event but it’s something I’ve wondered about for a very long time. I have a bit of a Sunday tradition with my father (who’s 83 now but in good health), where we watch sports all day on Sundays (NFL in the winter, and Golf during spring and summer). It’s something we’ve done for years and I’ve missed it only a handful of times. Important point:

My close friends and family know this already, so it isn’t a surprise but it still causes issues At times. In addition to this (This question is a bit 2 pronged), I am a huge sports fanatic. I will refuse to miss certain sporting events (Masters For example), again people know this as I am up front about it, but it still creates issues. 

A good specific example is a big one. It was about 3 years ago it was my good friend’s daughter’s birthday. He had a party on Master’s Sunday. I didn’t go to the party. I still get shit for it over 3 years later. I’ve had issues with SOs in the past about this as well, as during certain events I refuse to compromise. I feel that because I am up front about this stuff, and let it be known during certain events and Sundays I will not be doing anything, I’m not in the wrong. But am I the asshole?"

I ended up kicking nicky out (that wasn't easy) and having a great night. I spent about $600 usd (this is important), and now my friend group is torn, some are on her side telling me she has jealousy problems and I knew that before I befriended her, while others are tired of her tantrums.They are also asking me 120$ dollars each since that's what I spent on each person (including myself) even the ones on my side are blaming now that I have different timings as them and they have to deal with the drama on their own.
How do I fix this, some of these people (ones on my side) are childhood friends and I might lose touch with them.
Should I apologise to Nicky? I'm not giving anyone cash tho."
681,1jpqgsx,No A-holes here,"WIBTA for pressing the idea of sharing a room with my boyfriend after being told no, because I am his sole support person ?","I’m 16, he’s 15. He has been diagnosed with a number of mental issues, including ones under the schizophrenic and bipolar umbrellas. In the four months we’ve been “dating” (it’s a platonic relationship, this is relevant), he, his therapist, and his mom have all seen and agreed that I am an amazing person for him to be dating and be around. I’ve shown that I am able and willing to comfort him, be with him, and help calm him down when he has an episode. 

This information, along with directions from his therapist on how to handle him if an episode happens, was emailed to our teacher/trip coordinator by his mom yesterday afternoon. Until this point, he and I had been rooming together. It was sent out in the email and everything. After his mom’s email was sent, our teacher said we had to redo the rooms and split us up.

I asked her why, and she said it was because we couldn’t be dating and share a room (she knew we were dating, she asked me and I told we were and “there will be no fucking around” and that was good enough for her). She said she was sorry, but administration said she has to split up any romantic relationships. I told her it wasn’t romantic, and she said it was a matter of how it presented, and there’s nothing she can do.

Beyond just “I want to cuddle with my boyfriend,” this is an actual safety concern for him. He’s worst at night, which is when we need to be in our own rooms. Our rooms are being taped, and if we leave our rooms after curfew everyone gets punished. His devices lock at 9:30, so we can’t even text if something happens. On top of that, the people he was made to room with are the two he most the most uncomfortable around, to the point he was debating not going.

My biggest concern with this is his safety, but he asked me not to say anything to our teacher. He sent an email asking if he and I could trade rooms and hasn’t gotten a response yet.

I want to say something or do something, and because it is technically a medical/safety concern I think something might be able to be changed, but I don’t want to push it or make him upset.

682,1jposb4,Not the A-hole,AITA for not doing my chores due to back pain?,"Monday of this week, I (F18) was home early from school. I was cooking something in the kitchen, as I had to sneeze. Immediately after, I felt this immense pain in my lower back. It was like something I never felt before and the pain was so bad, that my movement was extremely restricted due to the pain.

 I immediately texted my mom (F41) and told her about it. When she came home a few hours later, she stormed into my room, screaming at me that my pain can’t be that bad, that i am just lazy and that I should get up. I was supposed to throw my dirty clothes into the washing machine. I told her, that I really wasn’t able to, because I couldn’t lift something or even bend down to pick anything up because of how bad it hurt, but she simply wouldn’t believe me.

 This fight has been going on for 3 days, and today, she sent me this text: „ I'm disappointed in you. I thought I raised you to be a reasonable person. But I notice that you think about yourself first and foremost, and everyone else has to suffer. And the worst part is that you probably won't notice it (if at all) until these people distance themselves from you. You know that I love you, you're my child. But right now, it's really stressful and really getting to me.“

 I then told her that I was so confused that she didn’t believe me and that I was really hurt that she thought this way about me. She then said this: „And that's exactly what you don't understand. 
Of course I believe you, but you're also forgetting that I work in orthopedics and I know exactly what I can and can't expect from you. Stop lying to yourself and terrorizing others, just be honest. You're just lazy. And I'm the only one who has the courage to tell you the truth. Maybe it's better if you stay with your boyfriend for the time being. I can't stand your ingratitude.“ 

And after a few other messages she said this: „Oh my gosh, can you imagine what it's like when you're more or less told that you're doing everything wrong and are always wrong about everything, and you're always looking for your own mistakes and then at some point you think how bad you really are, even though you really only want the best and never wish anything bad for the other person. 
And yet I still doubt myself and I'm fed up with that. I know exactly what I've done for you and that I am and have always been there for you, and I won't let anyone tell me otherwise. Otherwise it will destroy me.“ Mind you, I did not accuse her of any of these things during our conversation or at any time before. I just want to know people’s opinions on this? I don’t know what to think of this."
683,1jpojn7,Not the A-hole,AITA for moving out and leaving my dad alone while most of my family is in a different country?,"I (21F) recently graduated college with a bachelor's and have been looking for full-time work in my field. Soon after my graduation, my family planned to leave the country to visit relatives and sell our parents' house, with the intention of leaving the United States all together. I chose not to go with them, as I'd rather live in the US and don't get along well with our family in the other country. My dad (67M) decided to stay with me.

While I've been searching for a full-time job, I worked as a cashier earning a decent but not livable wage. I have my own bank account, but my parents have control over it and can add/withdraw funds whenever they want. This is the same with my sister (22F) and brother (19M). A few weeks after my family arrived in the new country, I noticed the majority of the money I'd earned had been taken out of my account. I asked my mom (57F) if she took it and she suggested that we hold a family meeting about finances. I agreed, and we arraigned for a time that would work for the whole family.

During this conversation, I asked if I could keep every other paycheck or a minimum amount from each paycheck so that I could pay off student loans and save up to eventually move out. I won't get into the details of the interaction, as I don't think a lot of it is relevant, but things became heated and my mom made it clear she wouldn't allow it. After the conversation, my dad tried to console me and figure out a way to resolve things. We agreed to have another call to sort things out.

During the second conversation, I restated that I wanted to keep some, not all, of my paycheck so that I could save up money. I didn't mention moving out, as I believed that was the thing that made my mom upset last time. My siblings, mom, and dad made it clear that I wouldn't be able to keep my paychecks and that they would instead go towards paying off the money my family spent on my college education. Afterwards, my parents would continue to take my paychecks, but that I would be able to ask for the amount back if I wanted to buy a car, pay for my wedding, etc. They assured me they would keep track of the amount that they took.

I ended the conversation as calmly as I could, but I felt trapped. My partner (20M) had previously said that he had made plans if I needed to leave home in a hurry, and I told him I needed to leave that night. It's been a month since then, and I've been slowly building a life in a different state. I have control over my finances, a full-time job in my field, and a support system. I don't regret moving, but I'm worried I made the wrong decision by leaving my dad home alone, especially since he's in his sixties. AITA?"

We remained friends. He started being really clingy. He gets really close sometimes and gets touchy (It was never inappropriate!). I do show discomfort but never tell him directly in the moment, cuz im kind of scared and don’t want to cause trouble, especially since it’s in public. 

Recently he started texting me, he feels really sad and unloved and that he needs me to show affection, give all my attention and keep talking to him. I keep telling him that I’m not comfortable with physical touch* nor talking all the time. Big part of my mental issues is my social battery constantly being drained — I’m working on fixing that but it’s really difficult. He keeps telling me that all he cares about is me and my happiness, but it feels like he needs a whole different person than me. 

For example today: We were in the bus and he told me to lay my head on his shoulder - I told him no and he got really sad or mad. The night prior we talked about our issues and he asked if the next day on the bus I could lay my head on him. I said yes because I was scared to decline, so it doesn’t make him sad again. I didn’t keep my promise so that is my fault. But it’s the same with everything else, where he’s forcing me to do something I’m not comfortable with doing and then tells me I don’t care about him. Which is not true I do care about him, but he keeps disrespecting my boundaries, instead of letting me be me. 

I’ve been struggling mentally for so long and recently I started prioritising my mental health and I do feel happier. Finally, I’m not feeling uncomfortable all the time at school and feel like I can communicate with people. But the constant pressure from Mark is setting me back a lot, it feels like I haven’t gotten better at all and still the most asocial person in the world. 

I feel like he loves the idea of me and not me. 

So AITA for not returning affection?


*A reason for that is that maybe I’m only comfortable doing that in a romantic context or just not with someone that I know has feelings for me and it isn’t 
mutual. I honestly think it’s both reasons combined.

686,1jpn0wn,Not the A-hole,AITA: In-Laws are upset with the name we want to use for our son.,"PLEASE help me and my wife out by letting us know who is the a-hole here:

My wife and I have two boys and are pregnant with our third boy. My wife's brother and his wife (Let's call them Jack and Jill) have a boy as well. After we announced to the family that we were expecting, the two sister-in-laws asked my wife if we had a name in mind via text message.

This is where things get weird IMO. My wife was like ""Yes! We're thinking of naming him Owen"" (Not real name but let's say it is for this sake).  My wife went on to say ""Jill, don't kill us because I know this might add some confusion for y'all!"". Neither sister-in-law replied.

THE REASON it might cause confusion is because on Jill's side of the family (Unrelated to us), they have a nephew named Owen. Note, we have never met this kid, and our families don't cross paths like that.

Jack and Jill are upset and went to my wife's parents before talking to us, telling my wife's parents that they are annoyed and don't want us to name our son Owen because in their mind, ""There's only one Owen in their lives. It would cause confusion for their 1 year old son having two Owen cousins, etc"". We heard from my wife's mom that Jill was going to talk to my wife and discuss this.

Me, being the husband, figured I would just call Jack (my wife's brother) and nip this in the bud. Especially cause my wife was super stressed/discouraged that the name was already causing tension. He couldn't talk until that night so I just sent him this text:

* **""No worries. While \[my wife\] was working out, I just wanted to nip this name thing in the bud. We love you guys, I dont want the drama. But in no way do you guys have a say in what we name our child. A little pissed that I even have to say that out loud.** 
* **\[My wife\] was super excited to announce the baby and the name. And now she’s stressed and there’s unnecessary tension. \[my wife\] shouldn’t have to justify/defend naming her own child.**  **I know they’re gonna have a call but there isn’t room for discussion on it. If we want to name our child whatever name, it’s ours to make. I hate to add to the tension but you guys put us in this situation and it really sucks.""**

Well that sent off an explosion. They're super hurt by the text, saying how agressive I was. I have already apologized to them for the text and said ""I was just trying to set a boundary, but probably took it too far"", etc. Also, since then, we have been trying to set up a call with them to get past this tension/drama but haven't had any luck.

UPDATE: Would like to know: WIBTA if we end up naming our son ""Owen"""
687,1jpm8eh,Asshole,AITA for hindering my flatmates,"I built a house and have housemates(paying considerably cheaper rent) living with me as I work away, and prefer someone to be at the house for security and the extra money is extra coin in my pocket at the end of the day.

I'm a single guy, late 20s and work away in a well paying job. I've got a couple living with me and I'm nervous I've overshot the mark by removing the lead to the theatre TV where they spend majority of their time while I'm away at work.

For context, they have their own bathroom and end of the house and I havent cooked for myself or watched anything in the theatre for over 12 months as I feel I shouldn't need to ask for use of the kitchen or theatre when I'm home. I understand it's their house too, they pay to live there and I spend majority of my time outside in the shed working on whatever projects, drinking beers and smokin cigarettes.

However whenever I want to cook or use the theatre I would have to ask for them to move somewhere else and its driving me insane, so I remove myself and go to the shed, even if I have guests.

I am the only one that looks after outside. Whether it be mowing lawns, pruning trees, weeding gardens, picking up leaves or maintaining retic sprinklers, everything. I often mop floors, unstuck the dishwasher, dust or whatever just to keep the house in a tidy, respectable fashion. I don't know how often they do this as I work away but it seems to be the same state as when I lived alone.

I pulled the plug to the TV in the theatre(still have a nice loungesuite) and hid it before I went to work as I believe that's the reason nothing is being achieved in the house. They cook tea and leave dishes and whatever else in the sink with oil all over the benches and make it a nuisance to use while they're watching TV in the theatre(they do clean up before bed but that's after when I'd like to eat).

Their bathroom is always full of her beauty stuff and whatever all over the vanity which have the sole use of. I understand she's a woman and they need this stuff to doll themselves up, look after their skin, whatever, and that's fine, but why can she not put them away and remove the coffee cups, open blocks of chocolate, hair clips, hair removal etc stuff and put it away. I have gone to others house instead of inviting them over because I'm house proud and don't like people using the bathroom/toilet in the state it's in.

I cannot imagine what the house looks like while I'm away so I try not to build an image. Theyre nice people but have never accepted responsibility for anything. ""Bins not being full enough to take out"" so they stink the property out, 'Forgetting bin day' etc. Theres always an excuse and I'm starting to think im being taken advantage of. Please give some guidance because they're really nice people, but I have given years of my life away for this house, and to have it not respected for the relatively cheap price they're paying seems a bit of a joke."
688,1jpi86n,Not the A-hole,AITAH for unhooking the heater because my GF keeps turning the thermostat to 85°F?,"My GF and I have been living and traveling in an RV for about 3 years now, and we use a space heater and propane furnace. For whatever reason this past winter she's been cranking the space heater to 85°F and leaving it on, no matter what the temperature is inside or outside. I was OK with it during the winter cold because it would be 30°F outside and the space heater could never get the RV up that high if it tried. But now it's spring and it does get that hot inside. I've asked her multiple times nicely to put it at 70°F, or even 75°F, but she keeps cranking it. I've also firmly told her to stop. She refuses to wear hoodies and sweatxpants/PJs, and insists on only wearing underwear at home. I'm fairly certain she doesn't know how a thermostat works, and I tried explaining it to her. I'll get home and it's 80 something degrees, so I'll turn it off, and she'll just crank it back up when I'm not looking. I'll turn it off at night, and she'll turn it back early AM when she notices. I'm over it.

So, tonight, a few minutes ago, I took the heater and hid it in storage. I unhooked the propane to the furnace and removed the fuse to the furnace. It's 50°F outside, but still 75°F inside the RV. I know we're about to have a fight in two hours or so. AITAH? Idk what to do."
689,1jphsg9,Not the A-hole,AITA for coming home late,"Disclaimer: even though this post includes my girlfriend, I am not seeking relationship advice, and don‘t think I am breaking the rule.

Hello dear AITA community,

My girlfriend and I have been happily living together for a while now. We both work “normal” 9-to-5 office jobs. Usually, we wake up at 7:00 AM and go to bed early enough to get at least 8–9 hours of sleep. Getting enough sleep is especially important to my partner.

Recently, I became active in a band, which basically means having one or two rehearsals per week. The rehearsals take place in the evening—currently one on a weekday and one on the weekend (Sunday evening). On rehearsal nights, I sometimes don’t get home until after 11 PM, and sometimes even as late as midnight.

By that time, my girlfriend is already in bed. I try to sneak into our apartment as quietly as possible and disturb her as little as I can—I don’t turn on any lights, etc. There’s no drinking or smoking at rehearsals, so I come home in a completely normal state.

Still, this causes friction because she says she can’t sleep when I’m out that late, or that she struggles to fall back asleep if she wakes up when I come home. Additionally, she complains about the amount of time I spend with the band.

I love her and want to find a solution to this situation, but I also don’t want to restrict myself too much when it comes to my hobbies.

I just wonder: Am I the bad guy for sometimes coming home late and spending time with my bandmates?"
690,1jph9by,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my mom I can't be her sounding board about my sister?,"So last year, I(37f) went no contact with my younger sister(35f). She is bipolar and a alcoholic and will message me randomly at all hours of the night complaining about her life or other members of our family. Well in all this, she has a tendency to forget factual memories and insert mad up ones. Currently, she believes our father is dead and that he was amazing and misses him and thinks I and my mother are awful people for not caring about him (he was also an alcoholic and my mother's abuser). 

I went no contact because while drunk, she contacted me and left a Wall of texts about how she hated me, I was a goody two shoes, grimy and disloyal, called my son(5m) (my miracle Rainbow child) a Ahole, and said she couldn't wait to laugh when my husband leaves me like the last one. I went low contact a few months prior, due to her previous bad behavior and refusal to listen to any advice offered to her. 

So, today my mother brought her up while we had lunch and how she was blocked again from my sister because they got into a disagreement last week. She then told me how my sister sounded drunk while they spoke. I interrupted her and asked her to repeat herself, so she did. I lost it and started bawling. Two weeks ago, she told me my sister is currently pregnant with her 4th child. I am struggling to get pregnant and stay that way, I've had fertility issues my whole adult life. Once I calmed down, I told I was sorry, but I could no longer talk about my sister anymore with her or hear about her. It hurts me too much to learn about her mistreatment of my mother, her own children or anyone else. I just couldn't do it anymore. She got quiet and changed the subject, but I could tell it hurt her a bit.
So AITA to my mom here? "
691,1jpgvrp,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I stopped training a friend because he is getting too cocky?,"Hello everyone, my dilemma is as follows: I am a competitive Yugioh player (3 times regional champion and multiple tops at intenational events), and I got kinda popular in the region I played. However, I focused too much in the tournaments aspect and didnt focus on actually engaging with people. Therefore, I tried to expand my inner circle and teach a player that seemed interested in engaging with me. 

That started some months ago. Now, because of the training, this friend of mine started to get really good at Yugioh tournaments. However, he is becoming really cocky due to his improvement in the game, and I fell kinda dissapointed. Also, I feel like I have a part on it because of how good he is at the game know, so I was thinking about stopping our testings.

I kinda hinted the idea to him, but told me I was being an asshole for suggesting it because a real friend wouldnt do that. Also, that is because this ""exclusive"" behavior of mine that not a lot of people like me in my regional community and would prove to all of them that I am an asshole if I stop our testing. 

Thank you for the feedback. "
692,1jpgryt,Asshole,AITA for buying a plane ticket without my friend.,"i am told i am the asshole by my friends and family but i sincerely don't understand.  
 i 28NB autistic and she 27F. we are going together to a city so far away,in other places could be another country itself:  
The main point is a concert, i was thinking about the prices so i bought everything with anticipation. i was buying the plane tickets and then i thought she might want to go together so i told her and she said sure, but i guess she meant sure as in buy both tickets, i just bought mine. She asked how much it was so that she could pay me. i was confused but then i got it, i told her it was only my ticket i bought, and that's when she got angry.  
she said i don't consider her at all in anything, and that the trip is about us¨ not about me.   
so we should've bought everything together but i did it because it was cheaper and just logistically better with anticipation, I did it two months before the concert and she asked to pay about a week before the concert. ??

she said i was being too selfish and that she would have to reconsider going. (we already have the concert tickets) i asked her to tell me so that i could cancel and maybe get my money back because the whole trip was about us going for me too, but i just didn't think that getting there together was necessary. she isn't talking to me rn but i just don't get why that was a big deal.   
i told her about it before buying them, i tried to tell her every detail about it the plane the hour the code, i was thinking maybe she could buy the same one if she wanted to go together but i guess she didn't check what i sended so here we are.  
we are days from the concert so reddit am i the asshole? \*also if i am consider the asshole please explain because i already apologized but i still don't understand what i did wrong. "
693,1jpgal2,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling my mom out for being a liar in front of our entire family?,"Throwaway.

I (20F) have been living at school for the past year, about a 45-minute drive from home. I have a scholarship that lets me live on campus. At home, I live with my mom (47F), dad (45M), and older half-sister (25F), who visits often.

Recently, my mom’s side of the family started a tradition of brunch at my aunt’s house every other Sunday, including:

- My parents  
- Sister & her toddler  
- My aunt (mom’s older sister) & uncle  
- My cousins (around my age)
- My other aunt (mom’s younger sister)
- My grandparents  

Since the brunches started, I’ve been coming home on Saturdays and staying until 5 PM on Sunday.

My mom’s known for her baking, but most people don’t realize she mostly uses boxed mixes. She’s great at decorating, but when people compliment her desserts, it’s usually about the look, not the taste. I don’t mind boxed desserts, but I prefer baking from scratch. I’ve been baking from scratch for a couple of years, and I love it.

I typically bake homemade cookies or cupcakes the night before brunch while my parents are out. My mom always brings a boxed cake she decorates. She’s never had an issue with me baking until recently.

A month ago, I brought homemade cookies to brunch, and everyone loved them. My older cousin’s girlfriend even asked for the recipe! But my mom casually mentioned, “If only you knew the mess she left behind after making those.” Everyone laughed, but I felt bad. I’m clumsy, so I thought maybe I missed a spot and apologized for giving her extra work.

Two weekends ago, I used tablecloths to protect the countertops while I baked, but my mom made the same comment that Sunday. That’s when I started to suspect she was exaggerating, so I decided to test it.

This Saturday, I baked the cookies at my best friend’s house and brought them home in a container. I hadn’t touched anything at my house.

When Sunday came, my mom made the same comment about me leaving a mess. I snapped. I was angry, so I don’t remember exactly what I said, but it was along the lines of, “Aren’t you tired of making shit up to make me look bad? I know you’re lying because I didn’t even bake these here this week.” I told everyone I baked them at my friend’s house. Silence. My mom threw a tantrum all day, saying I was disrespectful and now everyone would think of her as the “mom with the mouthy daughter.”

Afterward, my sister texted me saying I shouldn’t have said anything in front of everyone. My aunt (mom’s younger sister) messaged me saying my mom does a lot for me and I shouldn’t have made it awkward. I told them I was tired of being publicly embarrassed by my mom and that no one ever calls her out. This isn’t the first time she’s embarrassed me or my sister, and I feel like she gets satisfaction from it. Honestly, I suspect she’s jealous that people like my desserts more than hers.

Now I’m second-guessing myself. Maybe I should’ve addressed it privately instead of calling her out in front of everyone. So, AITA for calling my mom out in front of the family?"
694,1jpfp3e,Not the A-hole,"AITA, Went off on my DND player after years of sitting idle","The idea is a goliath who was kicked out of his tribe as they dont want him ruling it and told him collect these 6 artifacts and he may return and take his place as the ruler, the first issue is that these 6 artifacts wouldve been left by supposed Giant gods. I never mentioned there being such gods in my world but I let him go on. So the first thing I told him was I didnt like the idea of giving him 6 artifact level items as they rarely get 2 in my games. Come today when I pitched the idea of the next campaign and said it would be based around the layers of hell, so nothing really relating to going around the world, which he then said ""Ill have to make a new character then"" and at first went on about how the character was half tiefling, by this point I kinda forgot the character, so i questioned why the character wouldnt work and then he reminded me that it was the character who wants to collect the 6 artifacts, I basically told him that for a character like that to work I would basically have to make the campaign centered around just that, which would make it a game for him with C simply there tagging along, which wouldnt be fun IMO, I wont lie when I say his response set me off a bit.

Him (G): If a player character coming into a campaign with a goal that involves trying to find stuff is something that is to complex for you to think of a way to implement it into an adventure then I’ll just make characters without goals for you then

Me: Your entire goal with this character is to have him travel the entire world with the only goal to find these artifacts in which i have already said my dislike for the fact of you want 6 artifacts, and then you have the balls to complain when i dont want to use your characters after a campaign has ended, you sit there saying that each of these artifacts would be found here, here, here, here, over here, and here as if i shouldnt have a say in where the they would be even if i did do this idea, in which again you decided they should span the entire world so yea G id say its a little hard to have you focus on something completely different since you have a habit of making characters with one goal in mind, in which when i try to convince you to have them grow its wrong and they wouldnt but then in one session you act as if their entire mind set has changed over night, so fine G ill make you happy as i always do because me and C dont get to sit here and have fun of our own, we dont get to play dnd without you so god forbid we need to cater to your every request or else you might just fucking disappear and we wont get to play something we both love to play, so fine G ill remake the campaign to cater to your idea, just as i always have, because you seem to never let me forget, you dm your own game and you have been doing this longer so you know better than i do."

The day of me moving he completely bailed. No text, no call, just ghosted me.

To my surprise, she also wrote poetry, and she showed me some of hers. It was all really happy, sweet poetry that she wrote. The only problem was that she then asked to see some of mine. The poetry I write is always really dark because I write what I feel in the moment, and I'm kinda depressed rn.

699,1jpeqka,Not the A-hole,"AITA for asking a friend if SHE understands wedding courtesy, or else she can't bring her 4 year old son (who is on the spectrm) .","I feel like there are 2 types of parents in this world. The first type of parent goes: ""I won't be raising a little shit."" The second type of parent goes, ""The world should revolve around my perfect angel.""

I myself have the 'tism and so do most of the people I socialize with, and this goes double for us. And I have noticed a huge difference in outcomes for kids who were raised by Parent Type 1 vs. Parent Type 2. 

The vast majority of my friends with kids are Type 1 parents. That's why I have absolutely no problem with having kids at my wedding. Because I know they will prevent their kids from being disruptive during the serious parts, and not just let them loose as hellions during the fun parts. 

I have ONE friend who is a type 2 parent, and I really feel for her son because he is going to face a lot of social rejection when he gets older. He is probably one of the most spoiled, inconsiderate children I have ever met, but it's really not his fault. My friend his mother is adamant that he should NEVER have to be considerate of others, and all adults and children should just accommodate all his whims and be ""understanding.""

So I don't hold it against him even though he's awful to be around, because it's truly not his fault. Nobody has ever taught him how to act in any form of interpersonal interaction. 

That being said, I really don't want him at my wedding, but I cringe at the idea of singling my friend out as the only person whose child can't come. And she certainly will want him to come, she doesn't go anywhere without him. 

The problem is I could see her handing him an iPad and having him play games on it at full volume during the entire ceremony and find it outrageous if anyone has an issue with it, because her son ""needs"" it and can't tolerate headphones. There are a number of things like that which I could see her doing or allowing.   
  
I wanted to broach the subject with her but not be insulting towards her son. The way I approached it was trying to get at whether or not SHE understands wedding etiquette. Such as not playing loud videos during the ceremony. I just wanted to figure out if there would be any issues, but apparently this approach made me an asshole according to her. "

I agreed! I’d hope everyone could have a close companion and since he never grew up with a close pet I thought this would be his chance.

The puppy was cute and we got her at a shelter since he just fell in love with her picture. A maybe 5month old beagle. His passion and excitement made me hopeful. 

We adopted her and I warned him the first few weeks would be rough due to potty training. She’s a puppy though so he should expect accidents. Two days later I come home and she’s gone. He took her to a “doggy boot camp” to be trained by a professional. He reassured me it was his dog, his decision, and his money. 

When she returned she was not potty trained and could barely hold her excitement on walks. They only taught her not to bark… then recommended a shock collar that they used in their facility.

Ok here’s where I might be the asshole. 
I never really bonded with her. Her energy and excitement was too much for me. I knew she was a puppy so I thought I’d try to train her but I couldn’t help but resent my partner for not taking the time to train her himself. He wouldn’t take her on walks. When she pooped (and I’m talking just massacring her kennel despite constant outside time) it added to my stress and resentment. When he would just leave her outside for hours, I couldn’t help but feel more resentment! She was either trapped in a kennel, outside in the yard, or in my house with me by myself trying to train her and cleaning her accidents.

I didn’t sign up for a puppy nor did I image getting a bigger dog. I brought it up to a coworker and she had retired parents who previously had a beagle, who they loved and cared for to old age, who’d also love a puppy, I thought it was fate. 

I brought it up to him and asked him to think about what’s best for the dog. And if he truly wanted to care for her, then great! We wouldn’t have to rehome her. He took some time to think then said to rehome her but I need to know that he’s only saying yes because he knows I just want to get rid of her and he never wants another pet again for the rest of our lives because of this and I should’ve given him more grace for his first pet. Then he compared it to a made up scenario of him getting rid of boo. It turned into a heated argument. 

But what do you guys think. Am I an asshole for this? "
702,1jpcl09,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to listen to my boyfriend’s music while watching TV?,"Me (26F) and my boyfriend (27M) have been together for six months and recently moved in together.

In the entire time that I’ve known him, he has been a kind, caring, loving man. I can see him being the father of my children. But since we moved in together, I’ve discovered he has one extremely annoying habit: he insists on listening to  music while we’re watching TV.

I mean, we’ll be sitting down and watching a show and he’ll be blasting music on a speaker while we do it. It doesn’t matter what the show is. He’ll listen to anything: country, death metal, classical, rap. Ive brought this up several times, telling him that it’s incredibly distracting and makes it impossible to concentrate, much less enjoy, whatever we’re watching. But he says it’s the only way HE can keep his concentration, and sometimes will go so far as to mute the show or movie and just watch it with subtitles and his music playing.

My breaking point came the other day when we were watching Twilight. He had already been playing songs, but midway through the movie, he muted it and started absolutely BLASTING Breaking Benjamin. I had enough and told him we could either watch the movie like regular people or not at all. He got really upset, turned off the movie and the music, and stormed off. It’s been three days and we haven’t turned on the TV since. AITA for refusing to listen to my boyfriend’s music while watching TV?"

704,1jpbyx5,Asshole,AITA for the April fools prank I pulled in my sister?,"I 14m pulled a prank on my little sister today 10f for April fools day cuz I thought it'd be funny but it ended up making her mad. 

Our family loves horror, I read and watch a ton of horror and our whole family watches horror movies together and we all love it. 

We have Halloween decorations in our basememt of Pennywise, Freddy Krueger, giant spiders and all kinds of other stuff, and we also have a Chucky Halloween decoration. I went with the Chucky decoration cuz it would be the easiest to get out and back in. 

My sister had soccer practice today so I put it in her booster seat in our car to scare her before she went to soccer practice. And it worked. 

She asked if i put it there and when I said yeah she got really mad at me cuz when it happened she was with her new friend who she really likes and her friend saw her get scared by the Chucky decoration and laughed at her and now she's really embarrassed. 


I told her it was just an April fools joke but she said I was a jerk for making her scared in front of her friend. 

I tried to tell her good luck at soccer practice before she left to make sure we were still good but she just said "" don't talk to me you jerk "". 


AITA? 


I apologized to my sister and explained to her I didn't mean to embarrass her in front of her friend and make her look bad in front of her friend, she  accepted my apology and we hugged it out. We're good now!

705,1jpbwal,Not the A-hole,AITA for trying to restart or try again a relationship with my stepmom?,"Advice?

Context: I am a 17F turning 18 in the fall, and I have two half siblings, one bio sibling, and a step mom (42) and dad (46). When I was roughly four my bio mom passed away suddenly to disease, and dad, rather suddenly, got engaged and married six months after her passing. Stepmom came in, completely changed the house, amd rules (understandably, I was a little shit back then). Ensue this constant battle between me and her (Dad was severely disengaged and still grieving), and then she had a kid a little less than a year after they married, and then had another one four years later. 

As I grew up, I was severely sheltered and what felt like severe criticism I guess? (i.e. You can't make it anywhere, you're hopeless, no one cares, crybaby, I'll take you to the orphanage/ foster home). In middle school, I started to feel severely depressed and anxious and eventually I told her that I was having thoughts of well, things. She then proceeded to get pissed off, and left the room. So, I decided not to trust her with mental health matters. Now I am 17 1/2, and she has graduated with a behavioral health degree, and she says she knows what's best for me.

I at this point, am planning to high tail it outta there as soon as I turn 18 so I can have some peace, since my half siblings (her kids) are chaotic and loud as hell. She is angry (or frustrated, I can never tell, shes very loud) at me all the time, and has always said that she doesn't have to be my mom (I never asked her to), and she said recently that she thought she could save me and my sister from a mom less life, and she thought it would be easy since me and my sister were little. 

I have told her numerous times that maybe I would like to reestablish and just try to step back from each other, but she is very much making it a ride or die, mother and daughter relationship only. I however don't want that, and I don't think me and her should shove ourselves in that box right now. What in the ever living hell should I do? Is this situation toxic? "
706,1jpb7c7,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for investigating my mom?,"I (28m) and my mom (56f) have had a pretty decent relationship until a month ago ago. I'd been looking through my old things (2 months ago) as she had decided to move out of our old family home (it's decently big and she lives alone, she couldn't maintain it to well). There was this mint-green beanie baby rabbit, and then I remembered how I was good friends with a girl when I was around 8.   
  
TLDR: We went to their house, and when we went back the house apparently hadn't been lived-in for a few years. Keep in mind I was a kid and didn't question anything that my mom said. 

In any case, around 2 months ago I asked her about this. She became very defensive and straight-up told me that these people had never existed. I'd understand if I was a kid and maybe misremembered or had an imaginary friend, however I still had the bunny (which I'd taken from the girl's home). Along with the fact that she was not normally acting like this - she usually tries to put everything onto herself! 

I knew that this was definitely weird, so I asked a few friends and they all agreed that I should go show her the rabbit. When I did so, she flew into a rage and cursed me out. She NEVER curses. She said that I was being manipulative and ""how could you try and do this to your own mother"" and things along that line. She kicked me out that day and barely talked to me for the rest of the moving process, and she isn't answering my calls or texts. She leaves me on read, which is highly unlike herself. 

Would I be the asshole for trying to look into this further? Would there still be stuff from 2005 that I could use to help find out what the hell is going on?"
707,1jpaod8,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my friend that his other friend is gasping behind his back?,"(Gossiping, not gasping) Last semester, I was in a friend group with Jack and Philip. We used to have long calls together and were close. I also had another friend, Michael. We had drama last summer but forgave each other and became good friends again. My other friend, Louis, changed schools two semesters ago. He’s still close with Philip, but after everything that happened, I don’t know how to feel about either of them.

Jack hated Mike but acted like his friend while constantly gossiping about him. This started after Mike and another group planned an outing, invited Jack, but then canceled and rescheduled without re-inviting him. Jack never let it go.

One time, I added Louis to a call since he’s close with Philip and me. Louis commented on Jack’s voice changing, and Jack got super defensive. They argued, and since then, Louis has disliked Jack.

Fast forward—a substitute teacher came in, and our friend group (Philip and Mike are not included bc they were in another class) sat together playing Truth or Dare. Someone asked Jack if he cared about Philip, and Jack admitted he doesn’t really pay attention to Philip’s talks and only kind of cares about him.

That stuck with me. Later, I told Louis about Jack’s gossiping. Louis suggested I confront Jack, but I was over the friendship, so instead, I told Mike everything. Mike said he had been getting weird vibes from Jack and suspected he was still mad about the canceled outing. I also mentioned that Philip knew Jack had been talking badly about him because he was in the call when it happened. Mike decided to unfriend Jack and told Philip he should too.

The next day, I skipped school, worried about how things would go out. After school, Mike texted me, saying Jack denied half of what I told him but admitted to some. Jack also said snitching is a sin (even though gossiping is too). I told Mike I swear Jack said those things.

Then, I got a group call from Jack and Philip. Turns out Philip didn’t back me up—he just stayed silent. Jack called me a liar and said no one wanted to talk to me anymore, so I was being kicked out. I told him Mike deserved to know.

After the call, I texted Philip, reminding him that he was there when Jack gossiped about Mike. Philip told me I should apologize because I did something “very wrong.” Eventually, Mike unfriended me, I barely talk to Philip, and I was fully kicked out of the group.

Months later, the group turned against Mike too. I don’t know exactly why, because the only information I got is from Louis, and it’s not a lot. Now, Louis wants to go out with Philip and Jack and offered to tell Jack that I’m sorry and regret what happened. I told him no. Why would I want to reconnect with someone who bullies me every day because of what happened?

Louis insists it will work out and even said he had a vision that I’d thank him bc I’m “so alone right now.” Honestly, I’m so sick of friendships at this point. Am I the asshole?   (Again Sorry for the gasping and gossiping typo) "
708,1jpab1m,Not the A-hole,AITAH for not agreeing with my gf?,"Today in the middle of my (25M) work day my gf (24F) texted me “so do you not like me anymore or something; you don’t ask me about my day or anything” The text caught me off guard as it was out of the blue. So I replied “what? Im still at work and I ask u that pretty much everyday”  She then says I am invalidating her feelings because I wont just admit I dont ask her about her day everyday. But, I do ask her most days (some days I get home when shes asleep. Maybe once every 2 weeks or so)

I have been working extra + have been busy with side work on my day off for the last few weeks, but I have still spent 100% of my free time at home talking or watching TV with her when I am home from work. Last night I was particularly exhausted, so I was quiet and watching TV having a beer when I got home (which is uncharacteristic of me). I knew she’d feel a type of way about my tired mood so I texted “I am so beat I cant believe I still have 5 more days of work after this” before I left work, to which she ignored and told me she is going to her friends house. After gf arrived home a couple hours after me she asked “what are you sad or something” to which I replied “No I am just really exhausted” and I spent the rest of the night resting with her on our couch before turning in early. Usually we talk more but with so much going on I just couldn’t do anything besides sit or sleep. 

I understand she is asking for validation in her text message, but I feel the way it was done was very inconsiderate and accusatory. I have been putting in as much effort as possible given my current schedule, (cooking for both of us daily, doing chores during my day off, and talking to her about whats going on in her life at the end of the day) so I felt upset over her asking me in this way. I even asked her what more she would like me to do and she couldnt even answer the question. When I explained my frustrations with her question to her she just said “ok then” “ok” 
It is hard to not feel that she is projecting. 
I don’t think disagreeing is the same as invalidating, and feel like I am being blamed for her feeling insecure (which she has a history of doing to me) 
Or AITAH and invalidating her feelings?"
709,1jpa51m,Asshole,AITA for forbidding my girlfriend from doing household chores?,"A few years ago while putting together furniture, my (26m) girlfriend (27f) injured her wrists from using the screwdriver. We ended up getting her some wrist braces until the pain went away. We eventually checked with a doctor who said it was no big deal.

Since then, I've slowly forbidden her from doing chores around the house. I noticed that doing these chores (sweeping, scrubbing, cleaning dishes, etc.) would consistently agitated her wrists and she wouldn't be able to work on her actual job (small handmade crafts that require a lot of wrist usage.) I kept seeing the pattern of her straining her wrist on chores > bail out on her job after an hour or two and have to wear her wrist brace until the next day. She does love her job and when things go well can happily work up to 6 hours a day on her crafts, so since I can't do her job for her I want her to be able to focus on it.

I have no problem doing these chores, but today I caught her scrubbing a pan when I'd just reminded her yesterday to leave them alone and told her to call me if I'd missed one (and I would have hustled over to do it.)

She told me I'm being overbearing and that she's fine to scrub a pan, but I don't want her getting injured or develop worse long term damage.

AITA for insisting on doing the household chores?

Edit: Some clarifications.

- I should have put ""forbidding"" in quotes. I can't really stop her from doing anything besides maybe chiding her afterwards. I'm not her dad lol.

- I have shown her this thread and she agrees my version of events is more or less accurate but she still feels she's right.

Edit 2: Hello everyone. I stopped responding yesterday because I basically had the answer I needed 10 comments in (I was being the asshole lol) and then this post ended up getting almost 300. I actually got chided myself for spending so much time responding to messages that I ended up slacking on my work.

- I've gotten her a little jig to open soda cans with. I didn't know these things existed until yesterday.

- A lot of people are trying to diagnose her in the comments. We'll keep your ideas in mind the next time we go to the doctor/specialist (and I'll accompany her (if she wants) since people have let me know doctors don't always take women seriously.)

- I appreciate the level headed comments that aimed to help me understand her perspective more (which is why I posted.) To the people voting ESH she says: ""Why am I catching strays here? I just want to do the dishes!""

- Some of you are very angry lol

Thanks to those who helped!"
710,1jp9ze7,Not the A-hole,AITA for wanting privacy after I give birth?,"My bf and I were asked to stay by his mother at her home with our baby until we found one of our own. I wasn’t sure about this idea due to lack of space and privacy etc but agreed when my bf said his mum was talking to her friend about switching rooms as hers was at almost 3x the size of the other room. So he spoke to her about it and In return to switch she wanted a new bed, painting walls and doors to be done, and a few other new furnishing items to which we agreed. After returning with paint and supplies she let us know that even after switching she wants to keep a laundry rack in there to use when she washes her clothes which I was a bit worried about as there will be a newborn in the same room as well as myself recovering in a few short weeks. I thought it wouldn’t be the most comfortable idea especially when I’m breastfeeding or baby is napping/ crying etc so I suggested we move the rack to a different area where there is enough space to house it. I figured this would benefit everyone as no one would need to tiptoe or stop their laundry due to a newborn and it would also give me and baby privacy to bond, feed, change etc. my bf agreed and thought his mum would agree that it was for the best for everyone too. When he spoke to her about the idea all I could hear was shouting and when he came back his demeanour changed completely. He started saying things like “you can’t just kick her out of her own room” “so she’s never allowed in the bedroom?” And “who cares if there a baby in the room, she should be able to do her laundry” and other things to that effect. It made me feel like the biggest villain when I just value my privacy and think at such a delicate time that a rack being moved wouldn’t be an issue? So now I’m not sure if I’m being horrible for asking for privacy. I completely understand that it’s her home which is why I was hesitant to live there but she really wanted the baby here and kept asking for us to stay so I’m just confused over why a small clothes rack being moved is such a big issue. Aita? "
711,1jp9iwx,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for taking my brothers new cat from him?,"EDIT: We have taken the kitten to the best vet/shelter in our area!! My mom finally agreed with me and decided to find a good shelter, no matter how far out from our house, that could help the kitten as much as they can, promise not to euthanize it for space, and also rehome her once she’s healthy!! We did it while my brother was at school. Thank you all for your advice and affirmation, here’s to hoping she recovers and can be placed with a nice loving person/family!


My brother (20M) recently brought home a small injured kitten that I (21F) and my mom (63F) immediately fell in love with. We all thought she was adorable, but noticed my brother was being very weird about the cat. When I first saw her she was so small I couldn’t even tell how old she was, maybe around 4-7weeks. She was extremely scared and constantly crying and wouldn’t let anyone touch her. She was also limping and moving her leg in a very weird way. 

I asked my brother where he found her and what was wrong with her leg and he said, “it was stuck underneath my girlfriend’s car seat and I tried to get out for over an hour but I got tired of trying so I yanked her out.”

At this my heart dropped. I asked him how he was going to take care of her and he just shrugged and said “I’ll figure it out.” My brother does not have a job and he is currently in school for HVAC. Cats that young (so I’ve heard) can’t be left alone for longer than 2-4 hours at a time!! 

I asked him where she was going to stay, he said he would keep it in his room. When I went into his room it was filthy with old food boxes and bags and bottles of piss scattered all over the place. I asked if he wanted help cleaning the room, he refused. I asked if I could give the cat a flea bath, he said no. I again asked how he was going to fund taking care of her without a job or time to properly take care of her and he  got upset.

When he was at school today I got off from work and checked on the kitten and she was sleeping in the litter box but hasn’t used it and hasn’t touched any of the kitten food that I bought her to hold her over. 

Here’s where I might be the asshole. 

I told my mom that I was thinking about taking the cat to the Houston Humane Society or Mission for Paws or somewhere that has the capabilities to care for her in the way that she needs and can find her a home that suits her without my brother knowing, because I think if he knew he’d get pissed and run away with the kitten. 

My mom got really pissed and said it would be wrong of me to do so, and that it would be an asshole thing to do, but I disagree. 

I feel that it’s cruel and inhumane to keep a small animal with a seemingly broken leg and fleas in a small dirty room with no medical attention!! 

So would I be the asshole for taking my brother’s new cat to a humane shelter without him knowing??"
712,1jp9do9,Not the A-hole,AITA for not rooming with my sister in college?,"My sister, my best friend, and I are all going to the same college. I want to room with my friend.

For some background, my sister has always struggled in school, while academics have come easily to me. My mom has always expected me to help my sister with her schoolwork, even when I didn’t take the same classes and didn’t know the material. Now that we are adults and going to college, my mom still insists that I need to support her. She even told me, “If she fails out of college, it will be your fault,” just because I don’t want to room with her.

I’ve tried to explain that I can still support my sister without being her roommate. I also pointed out that every other student without a twin has to find a random roommate, but my mom insists that I am abandoning her and that I’m responsible for her.

I don’t think this should be my problem anymore. I’m finally excited to have my own freedom and make my own decisions without my mom’s influence. She always tries to guilt-trip me into doing what she wants, and I usually give in, but this time, I’ve decided to stand my ground and do what’s best for me. My mom told me she hopes I am miserable. I know there is no way I could possibly be responsible for my college courses and someone else’s. 

Please be kind and honest in the responses! I have never posted on Reddit before! Thank you 😊"
713,1jp92zz,No A-holes here,AITA for asking to work 4 days instead of 5,"My family moved town recently and the way we have our week setup is our child is in daycare 3 days a week and those are the days my partner works, she makes more per hour than me but finds the idea of working more than 3 days exhausting and we also dont want our child in daycare more than he has to be. So 2 days of the week she is with them by herself until I finish work. Lately she has been asking and making comments that she thinks our child wants 1-on-1 time with just me, because our weekends are spent as a family, yes sometimes I take them out to the shops or for a swim/park but its not a whole day thing. 

I both want to do this because I love spending time with our kid but also feel like it eats into our limited family time. And i also partly feel she is saying this because she wants a day to herself each week too, which is understandable, but because her 1-on-1 days are while im at work, i will never have the same opportunity to have a break day.

I suggested I drop to 4 days a week, and she increases to 4 days that way we each have a day with our kid separately and also family weekends together. Our financial situation would also be better because she earns more per hour. She got upset saying I already know how exhausting it is for her to do 3 days, so 4 would be too much. But i feel like her days off are exhausting any way because she looks after a 3 year old by herself...

So AITA?"
714,1jp8v3e,Not the A-hole,AITA for not really liking my friends (also my roommates) anymore?," I (F 20) live with 4 other people in a college house. I met 3 of them freshman year and one through a friend and we decided to live together which at the time sounded so fun. I was extremely close to two of my roommates let’s call them Andy (M 20) and Leah (F 20) since freshman year. By close I mean I lived with Andy the summer inbetween our 2nd  and 3rd year of college and me and brylee were joined at the hip since we got close freshman year. Everything was going great after we moved into our house at the beginning of our 3rd year until October. On Halloween night Andy, Leah and one of our other roommates left me behind at a bar at closing time (2:00am) and didn’t respond to any of my calls or text or event text me to see where I had gone. It was busy so we had gotten separated leaving the bar but since they were responding to anything I decided to make the 20 minute walk home alone because I couldn’t afford a Lyft home on my own (I live in the capital of my state so during holidays Lyft prices are insane). It was scary walking home alone and I was upset with them but I didn’t actually get angry until I receive a text saying “we’re on a separate journey” from Leah. I don’t know why but this pissed me off so bad. After that I proceeded to give them the silent treatment (I know childish) because I thought they knew what they did wrong cause I literally told them they left me. After about a week of the silent treatment I went to a different country for a project team competition and then the following week I went to a different state for a conference. So I had not talk to them for about a month after the initial incident. Once I got back they blew up at me calling me childish and out of my name. I understood why they’re were upset but I still had not received and apology for being left alone as a women in the capital of our state at 2:00am. Honestly I had gotten over it by that point and wasn’t not talking to them because I had a trip and responsibilities to take care of. Plus I have lupus which can be triggered by stress so I chose to ignore the problem so I didn’t flare up (which is why I understood why they were angry). We kinda made up but I only got an apology from Leah and a half assed apology from Andy where he still acted like me giving them the silent treatment was comparable to putting my life in danger. Ever since then I feel disconnected from them and they seemed to bond over the experience. I notice it in little ways like the way they interact with one another vs me or who they will ask to hangout/study with. I honestly don’t really like them anymore but I have no choices since we are roommates and we already signed our lease for next year . I know I didn’t approach the situation the best way but I kinda just don’t ain’t to keep telling like an outsider with them anymore and that feeling just keeps growing. AITA? "
715,1jp8esb,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my mom to pay for something that she destroyed when I asked her to stop doing it?,"I 20F have a couple starbucks cups I bought and my mother sometimes uses. The starbucks cups must be hand washed in order not to deform them. I told her that if we use them to hand wash them. My favorite cup was put in the dishwasher and is deformed enough where the lid can’t be able to screw on. I explained that I told her before. I may be in the wrong but I asked since I’ve asked several times if she could pay for it since I didn’t even need it washed since it already was. If I messed up like this I would pay for it. She told me i’m a “taker” and i take from paying and never give. She said that if i make her pay i’m setting the line and she’ll never let me use anything of her and will never do favors for me. We already have a strained relationship since my parents are divorced and hate each other but they live together for my sister till she graduates and she is somewhat mentally unstable since she refuses to take her meds. I also don’t like the fact that she doesn’t want to get a job and i had to be the second breadwinner for the family. I’m sorry for the ramble at the end. AITA?

TLDR:My mom messed my cup up in the dishwasher when I told her many times not to and i’m asking her to pay for it.     

Edit: Thank you guys so much for responding it means so much that you guys took the time to comment. Just to clarify that cup was purchased at goodwill and I don’t want the full amount back I just want the 12 dollars that I paid for it 

Update: This happened on April 1st and I was trying to make small talk in order to put this behind us with my mother when i tried to ask if she wanted pizza hut she  completely ignored me i thought maybe she didn’t hear me but she told my sister she’s not ready to talk yet. I don’t know what my dad will do when he comes back on friday so wish me luck again thank you so much for the responses

2nd update: it’s april 7th and she still hasn’t talked to me this isn’t the first time that we haven’t talked the longest was a month and a half, i try to stay out of the apartment as much as i can but the last time i tried to stay out of the apartment i was put in some really bad situations were i was violated by men but it’s kinda my fault for walking around at 3am and alike I was wondering if there are any places to go to avoid my mom i don’t have a license and even though theres a lounge for my apartment i don’t feel that comfortable going because 2 men propositioned me for sex and I felt extremely uncomfortable.

But the problems he's asking for help with are the most basic things, like clicking yes or no on installing an HDD. He needed my help to put in his password that he set himself (it's literally our address number), i told him it twice ""It's 1234"", but he was putting in ""1124"", turns out he was putting in the wrong number all along and i had to get up and do it myself. Then he complained the hard drive wasn't showing up, he didn't even have it in all the way. 

I had just sat down and He complained the game wouldn't start and i had to get up again. In big bold letters, it said ""Copying From Disc"" and to please wait. 

But it's like he doesn't even TRY to figure it out at all. He needs me to do everything. And i don't get it, he's very adept at using a computer and a phone. If it was a serious issue, 

i have to keep geetting up and going in there, which hurts me (I'm a big guy and i have bone problems so getting up and down so much hurts me and it's annoying because it's such petty stuff.) I was in the kitchen and had to keep getting up, the cat nearly got my food because he kept asking me to come do stuff for him. Like i can't sit down for 5 minutes without being bothered about it

I just told him to try to figure it out himself before bothering me for everything. Then i told my mom i dislike when she buys him this stuff because i'm always expected to just do all the work"
717,1jp7jh3,Asshole,AITA for sending my ex a dramatic april fools text?,"So today I woke up feeling foolish and sent the following text to many of my friends and two of my exes who I still considered to be on friendly terms with:

“I need to ask you something and I want you to be totally honest with me. It might be awkward with us after this, but I have to know how you feel. I have kept this in for a long while and its about time I was straight up and just confronted you about it. I hope this doesn't ruin the relationship we already have. I just need to know and I can't see any other way to get over this. It just doesn't seem fair on me if I don't get an answer. I want you to tell me truthfully no matter what it is. I just want your honest opinion... Do you know the muffin man?”

I usually am the friend who sends out copypasta holiday texts to people who respond well and seem to enjoy them which did include my most recent ex. For some context, we dated about 7 months total and the last 3 months were long distance due to me relocating for a new job several states away. I did initiate the breakup after realizing he seemed to feel more strongly about me than I could reciprocate at the time and just feeling like I wasn’t going to get there since we had switched to long distance. I definitely feel like an asshole but it was a genuine attempt to give him a laugh for the day and my friends all have biased feedback in my favor since they know me and my goofy nature. They also expect these antics when it’s a holiday and usually aren’t fooled by me. Obviously it was a mistake to send it and I did apologize when he told me how it made it him feel without making any excuses but I want to see if a neutral audience thinks this was an AH move?

I certainly won’t be sending any to him again and likely won’t plan to contact him so any further contact can be on his terms but my previous ex of 7 years laughed it off and I think I am just a little thrown since I am used to being on friendly terms with my exes when things don’t end because of toxicity or in a disrespectful way."
718,1jp7it4,No A-holes here,AITA for not being my brother's best man (person)?,"My brother is getting married next month and most of his friends have bailed on him. I am his sister and he needs a best man. I am also a lesbian and dress more masculine. On top of that I am overweight and have been trying to lose weight because that also makes me uncomfortable. 

I am still pretty uncomfortable in my body and am uncomfortable with being a part of the wedding (other than attending). My brother's fiancé's family is pretty conservative (she isnt) I feel horrible but I don't think I can bring myself to be my brother's best man/person because I am still pretty uncomfortable in my own skin. The thought of a bunch of people staring at me and being this thing put on display even if im not going to be the exact focus literally terrifies me. My partner has been bugging me the past 2 days about doing it and that it won't be that bad. We fought for hours yesterday and when we came home from work today about it. 

 I already avoid embarrassing social situations like the plague and I feel like this will make me super uncomfortable. Every time I think of it, I want to throw up or do worse things to myself so I don't have to do it. 

I haven't said yes. In fact, I tried to explain how it would make me feel to be the odd one out in the wedding and no one seems to care. Everyone just thinks I'm being a jerk. He does have at least 1 maybe 2 more people he can ask. I love my brother but I don't think I can bring myself to do this. "
719,1jp7d32,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking why they would spend money they don’t have?,"I (26F) and my boyfriend (30M) have been together for a year now. We were broken up for about a month because we were both just in different places and needed to regroup. We got back together and now things have drastically changed. Before in our relationship we were fine financially. I would always try to contribute, pay for myself but he insisted to pay for everything I wanted/needed. Even going as far as to bump me out of the way when I try to pay for my items. It would turn into fights because I don’t want to seem like a gold digger if he’s paying for everything. Eventually I just have in because he insisted. Now that we’re back together apparently money is a big issue and he’s struggling financially to the point where we don’t even see each other more than once every other week because he doesn’t have money for gas. I was supposed to spend the weekend with him and asked if we could go on a date because we hadn’t been on one since we broke up a month ago. He said no and then told me things are going to change a lot financially. I said, “so no more dates.” We called today and he told me his plan financially which basically cuts our dates to zero. Basically stating we can either hang out for a long time and do nothing or we can go to dinner once. 

The part where I may be TA is when he told me his plan I was confused as to where this financial trouble was coming from. Before we were fine and since we broke up he’s been working a lot more and has gotten a raise so i’m confused as to where all that money is going. He got another credit card and spent $300 on unnecessary items. I was genuinely confused so I asked, “Why would you max out another credit card when you’re already having financial problems? That’s just another bill you’ll have to pay back.” He got mad and accused me of being a gold digger and wanting him to spend all his money on me when we’ve literally talked about me wanting to spend my own money in the past. Should I not have said anything? 

UPDATE: We’re done! After the call where he called me a gold digger I took a few minutes to gather my thought and texted him how much that upset me. He  just said, “srry.” Literally abbreviated and everything. I said that sorry doesn’t always fix everything. This is when he blew up. Took it from 0-100. Being extremely disrespectful. I stayed calm because it didn’t want to make things worse. But this comment took the cake. I asked him why he felt the need to call me a gold digger when all I did was ask a genuine question. He told me that stupid questions get stupid answers. So clearly he wasn’t sorry. I asked why he’s being disrespectful when I’m being respectful and being calm and he told me I deserve to be disrespected. Told me straight up that he has no respect for me and I need to earn his respect. That just told me everything I need to know. I stopped replying. Then he comes back and says he’s sorry he said it but it’s my fault he said it because I pushed him there. Absolutely not you’re not gonna blame me for your temper. I was done. I asked for my stuff back originally but honestly it’s not even worth the hassle. Just throw it out. He’s threatening to show up to my job with my stuff. Absolutely not. Just throw it out. Blocked him on everything. Thank you all for your comments. He was definitely no good and this feels like a weight off my shoulders. "
720,1jp77fq,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for hiding things from my own mother.,"So, I'll ofc give background, as I normally do.

So this started today at around 2:00 east time. Me and my mother were going to pick up my little sister from school. So we talked for a bit about how things were going outside and how I wanted to kind set up my room to be a ""studio"". Essentially, I wanted to save money to buy a mini fridge and other small items for utilities and have my own setup for working, gaming, studying, etc. so this sparks up a whole nother lecture from my mom about how my rooms a mess and I need to clean and how she went into my room while I was away and took pictures of my room. She pulls up these pictures after I told her I will be cleaning today and shoved the phone in my face.

This sparks a reaction out of me because one, this is my mother. She should not be acting like a child showing his/her parent a drawing. Two, she's being absolutely persistent and hyperfixating on my room being dirty. I told her ""okay I get it it's like I'm in my god damn room, every fucking day"". She leaves me alone after that.

Come time we pick her up and we're almost home. She starts ranting more about my room saying it needs to be as clean as if she cleaned it. So while I was cleaning, I found $10 that was missing. I go and show her my find and continue on.

Come some MORE time later and I'm attempting to leave the house to take a break as I've been working on cleaning my room from 3:00- as of typing this. She demands I only buy a drink and nothing more. She tells me that the $10 I found will not be leaving the house then says ""matter of fact, give it to me"". I tell her ""no, I have a spot I Save it"". It becomes an argument about her taking my money as she has in the past. 


(For a Little extra context as to why I said no. Every time I go out and try to do some work for some old folk I'll go buy a polar pop and some cookies at the corner store (costs exactly $4.15) this is like once a week. She has been taking the money that I make ($20-$100) to ""save"" it. I have never seen my money since). 

AITA?



(I'm sorry if I'm posting excessively it's a mix of things that are going on and things that have happened that I'm touching on)"
721,1jp5l6z,Asshole,"AITA for standing in the aisle and ""boxing out"" a woman behind me who wanted to the exit the plane first?","I recently flew on a domestic (USA) flight on United Airlines.  I was seated in economy class, row 31, aisle seat. Livin' large.

The plane lands on time in Sacramento. We stop taxiing.  The light dings.  I immediately stand up and get my bulky backpack out of the bin and then remain standing in the aisle, wearing the backpack over one shoulder.  

To be honest, I do this deliberately. I stand in the aisle while waiting to exit the plane so that people in the rows behind don't rush the aisle and get off the plane before me. 

As I'm standing in the aisle, I notice that no one in rows 25-30 has gotten up.  The aisle is only blocked by people standing from about row 24 and sporadically further up.

Do I ""shoot the gap"" and walk past the people patiently sitting in rows 25-30 and go stand behind the people in the aisle at row 24? Of course not. I have manners.  I wait my turn standing in the aisle by my seat in row 31. 

At this point, a woman behind me taps me on the shoulder and politely asks me to move, presumably so that she can ""shoot the gap"" and try to improve her exiting position by scooting up to row 24, or perhaps further if she could get those folks to step out of her way.

I ask why she wants me to move, she didn't speak much English but gestured that she wanted to move ahead me toward the inviting gap.  I responded that I can't do that, there are people ahead of us who are entitled to get off first.

She gave me a dirty look in Spanish, which I would translate into English as ""What do you think you are, the aisle sheriff, just move, you sad little man.""  

I refused to move, I stood there awkwardly blocking her from exiting for like ten minutes as I waited for all the rows ahead of us to deplane.

AITA?"
722,1jp5bu7,Asshole,AITA for Taking Credit for a Team Project When I Did Most of the Work?,"So, I (27F) work on a team at my job where we were tasked with putting together a big presentation. The thing is, most of the work fell on me—I did the majority of the research, created the slides, and even came up with the main points. But, when it came time to present, I didn’t give my teammates as much credit as I should have.

I’ve been working really hard lately, and I wanted this to be a moment where I could show my boss what I’m capable of. So, during the presentation, I kind of glossed over the fact that others contributed and made it seem like I was the driving force behind the whole thing.

Some of my teammates are annoyed with me for not giving them proper credit, but I feel like I put in way more effort than they did. I’m proud of the work I did, and I don’t think I should have to downplay my role just to make everyone else feel better.

So, AITA for taking credit for a team project when I did most of the work?

**TL;DR**: Did most of the work for a team project and didn’t give credit to my teammates during the presentation. Now they’re mad, but I feel like I earned the recognition."
723,1jp560l,Not the A-hole,AITA for not texting my friend when he's awake(due to timezone difference)?,"I know this guy a little that I met online. He lives in Spain and I live in a shithole(The U.S.) I don't always hit him up but when I do it's for a meme or something or a question. But usually it's late in the afternoon normally when I send him something. Than the next morning for me I see the response and a lot of the time he says something like ""dude I was sleeping"" or ""it was 2am"". 

  
When I text him I don't want a response immediately, I text to eventually get a reaction. And As far as I'm aware, I don't wake him up by texting. But am I supposed to text during the few hours we share awake together? "
724,1jp4v2v,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my friend about what her “crush” said?,"I’m 17F, and my friend Jackie (17F) is talking to Ryan (16M). Our other friend Julie (17F) and I don’t have real issues with Ryan—he just doesn’t talk to us much—but he does treat Jackie poorly sometimes.

One day, my best friend (who I didn’t know was friends with Ryan) mentioned that he had been talking badly about Julie. Even our teacher, who overheard, confirmed it. I told Julie but didn’t mention it to Jackie at the time.

Later, my best friend told me Ryan had also been talking badly about me, Julie, and Jackie. I was pissed because I had no issue with him, and the things he said were disgusting. On top of that, he has openly expressed that he doesn’t like African American women (despite being Black himself), so you can imagine how bad it was. I planned to confront him, but he wasn’t there.

I texted Jackie, telling her I was going to curse him out. She responded, “Tell me what happens.” (Remember that.) I didn’t tell her exactly why, though.

When I finally saw him, I went off. While I was confronting him, four people came up and told me even worse things he had said—how he doesn’t want to commit to Jackie, how she asks for too much, how Julie is annoying, how I’m “the Black bitch,” and that Jackie is just an acquaintance to him. He also said Julie stinks and a bunch of other nonsense.

I texted Jackie everything, but she kept saying, “Well, he’s denying it.” But four people had no reason to lie, and what made it even weirder was that Ryan suddenly stopped talking to all of them, even though they were his only friends. He doesn’t even know they told me. My best friend even offered to record him for proof.

Jackie still kept talking to him, which is her choice, but after that, she started avoiding me. In class, she wouldn’t talk to me, and in the halls, she and Julie would chat while I just walked away.

We hung out over the weekend at an event, but I wasn’t really engaging with her. Then today, Ryan walked by, and Jackie pulled me aside like I was about to go off again. She told me she was upset about what I did, even though she originally told me to update her. Now she’s saying, “That’s her relationship,” but what does that have to do with him insulting all of us?

Maybe I overreacted, but was I wrong for telling her? AITA?"
725,1jp4tpe,Not the A-hole,AITA for Yelling at my Mother?,"I am a kid born in the US, but my parents are from India. My mom, lets call her ""Atchu"" is currently studying in GED. I am a 15 year old (turning 16 in November) and currently endure all her yelling and screaming she does at home. We have 2 laptops at home, my school chromebook and my gaming laptop. I usually use the gaming laptop since its a larger laptop and Windows, which I am very comfortable with. And the chromebook is a slow device and the school blocks some websites necessary for me to do the assignment. Heck, even our teachers recommend us to use our personal devices for some of their assignments. But every time I use it and my dad is not home, she starts yelling at me and saying she needs to use it for her GED studies. Sure, OK, fine with me. But when I finally give it to her while she is doing all that yelling, she DOESN'T EVEN USE IT. She just scrolls on her phone on either YouTube or FaceBook. Today, I finally broke. As soon as my dad left for a doctor appointment, and I was using the gaming laptop (for school) she starts yelling and telling me to give it to her. I tell her I need 30 minutes only (compared to her 2-3 hours). She then starts saying she will message and call my dad saying I gave her the laptop when I saw my dad in the driveway. I decided to just give her the laptop only 10-15 minutes in, because I couldn't bear her yelling. I put the laptop in front of her, and SHE AGAIN DIDN'T USE IT. She was on her phone SCROLLING on FaceBook. I cracked and yelled at her saying why she tormented me for about 15 minutes for the laptop, only to not use it. She yelled back at me saying she will complain to my dad about my ""unacceptable behavior."" So I messaged my dad about everything she just said, what she did, and left to the library, which is a 5 minute walk from my house. I am currently typing this in the library. So again, AITA for yelling at my mother, because its Indian culture (and pretty sure for the rest of the world too) to not even QUESTION what our parents say. I think by yelling at her I broke a pretty big rule and I'm sure I will be punished in hell for this (that is what Indians say)."
726,1jp4rw8,Asshole,AITA for reporting my friend for alcohol abuse?,"Throwaway for anonymity—

This is a weird one. My friend (19F) and I (18F) go to different universities that are several hundred miles apart, but we’ve tried to stay in touch and meet up over breaks since we’ve know each other for 8 years and value our friendship a lot. Anyway, the past few months, we had kind of fallen out of touch. She wouldn’t really reply to my messages and I had enough going on with school so I stopped trying to reach out as much, assuming she was simply busy or wanted space.

Another mutual friend of ours (19F), who also goes to a different university, called me recently and said she was really worried about our friend (I’ll call her A) because A had frequently been drunk calling people and had even ended up in the hospital due to alcohol poisoning pretty recently. I asked if anything was being done to support A and help her find healthier ways to manage her stress, and my friend said that A was meeting with a therapist but that her parents didn’t know about the drinking and it was starting to affect her grades and such.

As someone who has experienced alcohol dependency in the past, I know how deep the hole is. Rock bottom has a basement. You don’t know it until you’re in it and you have no way out. I was really worried about A, and I suggested reaching out to her university’s alcohol/substance abuse care team to tell them what was going on. The purpose of the support team is just to reach out to impacted students and offer them resources (think AA student groups, group therapy, healthier coping mechanisms, etc). My university offers something similar.

I hated the thought of bringing more people into it or hurting A somehow, but being so far away, I truly am worried sick over her and know I wouldn’t be able to do anything if something were to happen to her as a result of her drinking so much. That’s why I pitched the idea. My friend seemed on board with the idea, but when I let her know that I had called the support team the other day just to ask them to check on A and offer her resources, my friend lashed out, saying it wasn’t my place to get involved.

Now I’m questioning my choice. I love A dearly, even if we don’t see each other as often as we did in high school. I will always want the best for her, and I’d hate to see her lose herself to addiction. It’s a rocky hill and a tough battle to fight, and I just wanted to get her help before things got worse. So am I the asshole in this situation?"
727,1jp4iwa,Not the A-hole,AITAH for not flying overseas with small kids for a last minute wedding?,"My boyfriend and I are Canadians living in Germany for the last 3 years. While here, we had our two kids aged 2 and 10 months. Although we make a decent living, we are big planners and enjoy knowing what we have coming up. This year, we made the decision to only go back to visit our family and friends in Canada either in December or January 2026 because that’s when we would have time off from work and my boyfriend’s handball league, as well as be able to maximize our visit to around 3 week’s time. As you can imagine, flying over 8 hours with two young ones isn’t for the faint of heart. 

Last week, my boyfriend’s brother and gf decided that after 17 years together, and two young kids (aged exactly like ours), they wanted to get married! Yay!!! Except, they wanted to do it ASAP this SEPT OR OCT. they are telling us that they won’t have the wedding without us and that our presence is super important to them (they don’t have any friends and my bf would be the best man). In normal circumstances this would be something so exciting and we would be over the moon to help them plan.

The issue we have is, in September, our eldest starts his first year at German Kindergarten (huge change from daycare) and our youngest starts daycare (in Germany this is a 4 week progressive integration which must be done without interruption if I am to start back to work in October), I will be starting work and my boyfriend will be starting his new position at work. Not to mention the fact that we wouldn’t be able to stay in Canada for more than a week since my bf plays handball competitively and the season starts in September as well. We would also need to pay for a place to stay for the week as well as purchase airfare during high season.

I know some might say that 6 months is sufficient time to plan, but for us, not only is the timing really inconvenient, we feel like their reason for doing it right away and not postponing based on the fact that they don’t know if she’ll be pregnant or postpartum next year, is such a weak argument. Everybody else attending is so flexible, and they are saying our presence is so important, yet they are not willing to move the date a little bit more because of a hypothetical scenario. 

My main issues are:
- timing is very difficult for us
- big expense for a visit we won’t be able to fully enjoy
- we would be going back home yet be unable to do much else than attend and participate in their wedding festivities

728,1jp3nly,Not the A-hole,AITA for not giving my crush my best friend snap,"**AITA for not giving my best friend’s crush my best friend’s snap?**

So, I (high school student) had a crush on this guy—let’s call him Santos. We would always make eye contact in the hallways, and eventually, I started liking him. My best friend (let’s call her Emily) had a crush on his friend, so whenever we saw them, we’d giggle and smile at them like typical high school girls.

One day, Emily suggested we follow them on Instagram. I followed Santos, and he immediately started texting me—just simple “hi” and “hey” messages. I was super nervous, so I didn’t reply right away. Eventually, we started talking, but the issue is that Emily had access to my account (I trusted her completely). Long story short, she ended up talking to him **the whole night**, and he was being extra cheesy, telling me (her) to bring a hoodie in the morning because it would be ""cold"" (it was literally hot that day).

She ended up arranging a date with him for me, but when I showed up, he **never came.** The next day, another guy randomly started talking to me, but I was dry because I was upset. Then out of nowhere, he started **insulting me and body-shaming me**, saying Santos never actually liked me and only started talking to me because he thought I was “easy.”

Turns out, **that ""other guy"" was actually Santos using a different account.** Emily was reading all of this because she still had my account. Then, *Santos* (on his fake account) asked for **Emily’s Snapchat**, and I told him **no**. Now Emily is upset and thinks I should have given it to him.

729,1jp3ine,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I told my coworkers to stop talking about my body?,"24f here. 

For years, I have been body shamed by my coworkers, they will always got out of their way to criticize what i'm eating, call me fat, thunder thighs, fat face, asking me if im pregnant etc. 

A little over a year ago I lost a lot of weight and went from a size 12 to a size 4 in 5 months. Now I am back to my normal size, after being out from an injury and also I had been slowly gaining weight back due to the fact that I am just in a better mental space now. 

 I have asked my coworkers to stop talking about my body when I was losing weight rapidly, when they were encouraging me to lose more and more and they got offended, telling me that they're giving me a compliment, that I should be grateful etc. Before that, I was always body shamed for being ""fat"".

Yesterday was the third time that someone had remarked on my weight the past month. 

One of my coworkers looked me up and down and asked me why I was big again, if I couldn't stop eating, why I had let myself go, asking me what various foods I couldn't stop eating  etc. I did not say anything and ended up leaving anyway because my shift was up. 

I didn't know what to say, this woman literally just came back from having a baby and that's what she wanted to say to me after being out?

I know that it is partially normal because I live in Hawaii, and people here tend to be comfortable saying UNPC things to people's faces without consequences. However, it's unprofessional in a work environment regardless. 

These people know that, and they don't care. However, whenever I tried to speak up about it I get accused of trying to change the culture. Not only that, but i'm these people's supervisor, so it's strange regardless of culture.

730,1jp32k4,No A-holes here,AITA for asking for more sleep?,"My husband and I have an 8 week old baby. Of course sleeping is extremely hard with a small baby but for me I feel like it's even harder. I work full time (40hrs) a week I do manual labor lifting heavy products loading and unloading as well as sometimes physically running for an hour or two to get people their orders. I work from 12pm-8:30pm. My husband is on short term disability right now and is at home with our baby full time. What we have been doing for a while is no longer working. Currently I get home at 9pm and we both watch our son, eat dinner, watch TV, ect together until about 11pm then I attempt to go to bed and he is ""on the clock"" with our son until 5am. Anytime after 5 it's my turn. Sounds fine? We each get 6 hours of sleep, fair is fair right? Well it's starting to not feel like it. At night sometimes my son sleeps through my husband's whole shift, although the more typical is he will wake up once at around 2-3 and go back to sleep meaning he potentially could get up to 11 hours of sleep. My son almost never sleeps through mine, he normally wakes up between 5-6 and I cannot get him to sleep any longer then an hour MAYBE two at most. So I am on average waking up at 6am and staying awake until 11pm while also working. That is at minimum, most of the time I can't even sleep in my allotted hours because I have postpartum insomnia. I get 2-5 hours of sleep at most (normally broken up) at night. I am running on empty and I'm missarable. Every time I bring it up to my husband or we try something knew he always says it ""feels unfair"", and gets annoyed. We've tried me doing night time and him morning but I have mental health issues and become delusional and angry when I'm running on no sleep, so it's best if I sleep first. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going crazy 

Note: I don't want anyone saying that my husband should do the entire night alone because he ""doesn't work"" being a stay at home parent is hard work it's mentally taxing all stay at home parents deserve breaks, as well. "
731,1jp2aef,Asshole,WIBTA if I called out my friends entitlement?,"Okay so this is kind of a long story, so bear with me. 

I (19F) have a friend (20M) who has a tendency to be incredibly entitled. He has done a lot of stuff in the past, and although he has struggled through a lot of things, he compares his trauma to everyone he meets like it’s some sort of competition. He does this to my other friends too, which leads to them not wanting to be around him - he doesn’t notice this at all and acts like everything is normal. 

The most recent example I can give is a concert. It’s important to note, he is physically disabled and is in need of a wheelchair sometimes. He can stand independently of the wheelchair, and has always been able to. 

Anyways, the venue staff failed to make sure there was enough room for everyone on the disabled platform and they ended up having to direct everyone into the regular standing area. Everyone managed to make it but one from the barrier, where a few girls refused to move because they had paid VIP tickets and gotten there really early to ensure a good space. They apologised as well as saying they appreciated the situation. I think this was a fair response, but my friend took offence and decided to leave before the concert started.

One of their friends mocked them before leaving too, saying “I get you paid for VIP, but you know, at least you can walk,”. 

Keeping in mind, my friend CAN still stand and walk, and they were only behind one person from barrier. 

I understand they’re disappointed but I think it was really rude and clearly upsetting, because the girl started crying after that. I want to bring it up to them, because it really tires me out that I have to keep acting like I don’t think their entitlement ruins a lot of good things, as this is just one of many experiences I’ve witnessed. So, WIBTA if I tried to talk to them about their entitlement towards this girl?

EDIT: sorry, I’ve phrased this kind of terribly - I’m just emotionally conflicted and I didn’t know how to convey it properly. To be clearer, I believe he deserves disability accommodation - the thoughts on entitlement was more towards the girl who wouldn’t give up her space. He always wants someone else to accommodate for him, even when it’s not their responsibility - and often times it has nothing to do with his physical disabilities, it’s just that in this instance it was "
732,1jp1uki,Not the A-hole,AITA for how ive acted to people,"Ive been having some problems in school socially. My friends have been ignoring me out of the blue and refused to talk or acknowledged me. They even hide/blocked me on any social media platforms and have been talking about me to other people behind my back.. for some time ive been wondering on what happened to make them act like that towards me all of the sudden. I was hurt because 1 year of friendship and memories was thrown out of the window all of the sudden..

Now, in january one of my friend from my dormitory pulled me aside to talk to me about something important. In the talk she told me how shes been frustrated towards me..she told me that ive been acting childish, annoying and immature...she said that she finds me talking about my interest that she doesn't know is annoying and draining for her and she doesn't like how i like to compare things and how i whine and complain too much. I listened and understood what she said while apologizing for my actions. She pointed out that other people have been feeling the same things towards me and how people only talked or tolerated me just because im friends with her....i apologized to her and explained how i didnt realized my actions were bad and i never meant to make anyone frustrated and drained..i said that ill try to change and work on myself more.

After that talk i decided to talk less and mind my business more...back then I would bud into conversations that im not included or invited to and I would me nosy and try to get into people's buisness...which i admit, it was shitty and i regret that. 

A 2 months went by and im still doing the thing ive been doing since the talk. Speaking less, minding my own buisness, only speak when im invited to a conversation or someone speaks to me first. It was doing good i supposed until...i noticed that people started to avoid and ignore me again...and then, my dormmate friend pulled me aside again. 

I already had a bad feeling about this because shes been acting cold and ignoring me for weeks...She pulled me to my room and she said how she was having a talk with some of my 'friends' and say that ive been acting worse than a few months ago...how ive been more immature and draining to other people so they started to ignore me again. She said how she felt like she feels the burden of trying to carry my social life even though ive never asked for her to do that and how she feels like a parent for having to talk to me about my own social life. I apologized and just go silent...

After she left my room i felt confused and frustrated on myself. I thought ive been doing well but turns out ive made the situation worse without me noticing. 

I made a vow to myself to not do anything anymore. I wont try to talk to anyone anymore. Just be silent...just be someone whos in the background because im scared that ill hurt someone else or hurt my friends more...

Thinking now im conflicted if this this the right thing to do or should i try again...

Am i the asshole in this situation?

733,1jp1s2o,Everyone Sucks,AITA for pointing out my black friend has white parents,"I am from a small town with mostly only white people, so when I went off to college I was not the best at being subtle about my naivety to other races. This was mostly through things deemed taboo, such as asking questions about experiences and finding boundaries. I admit I am fairly naive, but when I became close friends with a black person I started to settle into an understanding. I am overly curious and it can come off as odd, though they would usually answer any questions I had such as asking about hair texture, sunburns, different lifestyles, etc. My friend actually disliked me at the beginning of our “friendship”, this went on for months but I found out they were bored because their actual best friend was busy at work. They admitted they knew I would just go along with anything they wanted to do, despite finding me annoying. After a couple months they said they started to actually like me and we became a lot closer. I was fine with this but also a little hurt, so we would joke about it. 

That's when the insults started coming as jokes, calling me stupid or naive as an insult. The main insulting joke they would use, with everyone not just me, was “You’re white”. Which I found funny at first, but then it started becoming genuinely unfair, they would justify saying mean things to me by saying I deserved it for being white. 

It boiled over when I was at their apartment, I was high out of my mind and they had nonstop insulted me. I don't remember all of the conversations but at one point they said “You’re white, I’m black” to justify another insult, to which I responded “Raised by white people”. At this point they told me my comment was racist, which I didn't mean it to be but I understand how they took it as that. I apologized and they continued saying I basically said they weren't black because they were adopted by white people. This wasn't my intention, hence why I apologized. 

Now, after 5 texts apologizing, they have refused to talk to me and removed me from all their posts as well as unfollowing me. AITA? I know what I said was bad but I felt justified in pointing out that they constantly say they hate white people, and yet the majority of their friends are white and their parents are white! I am aware it's a joke but after so many “jokes” I became upset and lashed out. I’m confused and upset and I know they're going to tell other people about what I said, twisting it to make it sound worse, I lost my only friend at college with zero communication.

edit: the only reason I brought it up was to point out that their parents are white, and questioning why they constantly say they hate white people despite having white parents

edit: I do feel horrible for saying it which is why I apologized multiple times in person and over text, to which they said it was okay but are now ghosting me 

UPDATE: no longer friends "
734,1jp1g7q,Not the A-hole,"AITA for shouting at my friend, then not proceeding to forgive her?","I (16F) and my friend A (16F) have been close for 4-5 months. We both had our own best friends, and we all used to hang out as a group of four. Over time, A started acting distant, sometimes walking away sadly or not talking to us. I introduced her to some of my other friends, and she got closer to them,to the point where she started sitting with them instead of me.

One day at lunch, I couldn’t find A and her best friend, so I sat with a different group. Later, A acted upset, and I found out she had been complaining that I was leaving her out. When she confronted me about it, I lost my patience and told her I had other friendships to maintain. She teared up, but I walked away.

Afterward, I heard from multiple people (including some from the “secluded” friend group she was trying to join) that A had been talking badly about me. When she later tried to apologize, I didn’t accept it because I felt she wasn’t truly sorry, just caught. This led to a huge argument in the changing rooms, where we both shouted at each other, and I told her I hated her.

Over the next few days, she kept trying to talk to me, but I ignored her. She even waited for me outside class and tried knocking on my cubicle. She eventually started crying and going to the nurse frequently. When we were forced to talk by a teacher, I told her I needed time, but she didn’t seem to accept that. Meanwhile, she started forcing herself into the secluded friend group, making some of them uncomfortable.

Then, I heard that she was spreading more rumors, calling her own best friend “two-faced” and saying I was a bad influence. She also twisted things I had said about another girl, making it seem like I called her manipulative. My best friend, who was there at the time, confirmed I never said that.

To make things worse, her best friend,who had always supported her,finally saw her true colors when A publicly called her a liar. I posted about the situation on my close friends’ story to stop the rumors, but A found out and started asking people about it.

At this point, I feel like we were both in the wrong, but she refuses to take any responsibility. So, AITA?"
735,1jp1f00,Not the A-hole,AITA for not watching my nieces?,"I 22M have recently moved closer to my siblings. I have two sisters, one with three kids and the other with two. Before I officially moved, I had told my sisters that I am not a babysitter as I knew they would try to guilt trip me because I had been so far away from them for 5 years.

Picking them up from school and the occasional hang out at my place is fine with me, but I don't want watching them to become a normal occasion as I have my own life and things to worry about. 

Now, I love my nieces and nephews and when I was in high school would watch them from time to time. But now that I'm older I want to worry about my own life and not have to constantly be the family babysitter.

Apparently, I wasn't clear enough as last weekend my sister let's call her Ana and her husband wanted to go out with friends from work. So, she called me to babysit while they went out. I was particularly exhausted from work that night, so I declined because I just wanted to take a shower and go to bed. Plus, I know this particular sister wouldn't be home till 1 or 2 am. She has always loved to party and never wants it to end. What I was not expecting was one of the biggest arguments between Ana and me.

She called me selfish for not helping her out and claiming that I didn't want to see her kids. I wasn't exactly an angel myself in my response I won't lie. She quickly involved my mom who told me that Ana would do the same for me and that I should just do it as it wouldn't hurt me.

I was pretty annoyed at this point and reminded both of them that I said that I was not a babysitter before turning off my phone and going to bed. My mom and some of my friends still think I was overacting and one suggested that I take it here.

So, AITA for not watching my nieces even though I clearly told my sisters that I am not a babysitter? Should I have just toughed it out to avoid all this drama? At this point I don't know. "
736,1jp0wq2,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to comfort a guy who opened up about feeling guilty after using someone else?,"I (F, 30s) had an emotionally intense connection with a guy (M, mid-20s). I’m a single mom with two kids, 7 years older than him. He knew this from the beginning and never seemed to have an issue. We spent nearly all our free time together and had deep emotional and physical closeness.

He used to say things like *“I love you,”* *“You make me so happy I could climb the walls,”* and *“I’m the luckiest guy in the world.”* Later on, though, he admitted he wasn’t really attracted to me, because I’m older and have kids. He also said that everyone who likes him is either “weird or desperate.” So while telling me I was amazing, he was silently judging me.

Every time I tried to end things, he begged me to stay. Eventually, I blocked him to protect myself.

When we reconnected weeks later, I found out he had slept with a girl who had been in love with him for a long time. He said he didn’t like her, that the sex was bad, and that he did it only because his self-esteem was low. He also trashed her — said she was sick, angry all the time, and that he panicked at the thought of a pregnancy and realized he didn’t want her at all.

He started calling himself *“a loser”* and *“scum of the earth.”* I could tell he wanted me to comfort him and tell him it wasn’t that bad. But instead, I said, *“Then stop acting like that. It’s not a curse. You can change. I’m not saying it’s easy, but it’s simple.”*

Then I added, *“You feel bad because your behavior bothers even you. That says a lot. It can change.”*

I said it calmly and with honesty, but he got upset. Said I wasn’t listening, that I didn’t care, that I felt distant. Then he ghosted me completely.

So now I wonder:  
**AITA for not comforting him when he felt guilty and needed support?**

  
EDIT / UPDATE:

Just to clarify: 

The moment I found out how he saw me (as “weird,” “desperate,” and “not really attractive” because I’m older and have kids), I was furious. I was in shock and needed time to process it. I didn’t try to reconnect emotionally after that. The only reason we spoke again was because I wanted to know how soon after I blocked him he slept with that girl. It felt important to me because I predicted that would happen.

I didn’t expect his reaction to be a tantrum followed by silence. And didn't expect he would say such horrible things about her. He always played the role of this pure, innocent, wholesome guy. I just realized he is a text book nice guy. I was honestly in disbelief. I thought my brain is glitching or something, and misunderstood him or did something wrong.

737,1jp0a41,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my brother in law to stop picking on my kids or he’s not coming on vacation?,"I have three kids, Rob (16m), Lisa (14f), Anne (9F). Lisa is autistic, and her special interest is Taylor Swift. Rob and Anne go along with it and indulge her. They’re good kids who care and support each other and Rob and yes Anne get attention and support for their interests too.

My brother in law Hector's entire personality is trying to rile people. You know the whole “it’s just a joke bro”. Super childish but whatever “he’s family.” Except my husband is out of the country, so I guess he thinks he gets to do whatever he wants.

A few weeks ago he started needling at Lisa by making fun of Taylor Swift using lots of childish name calling words, intentionally using the wrong word for fans and stuff. Just really immature kid stuff. Lisa knows that not everyone likes TS and some people even hate her. One of her best friends hates her. She’s not unable to hear different opinions. She has her own I’m sure she’d LOVE to share with you all if you had 4 hours to spare.

He would say “Well Swiffers did x y z” she would say “Uncle Hector it’s Swifties” and he would say it again to needle at her. Rob was in the room, I was not. Rob said to him “Why do you keep using the wrong word, she told you the right word?”

Hector said he can say whatever he wants and to “cry about it.”

Rob said “It just seems like you’re going out of your way to upset Lisa”

Rob asked her to finish what she was talking about and to ignore Hector. This is when I came into the room, and Hector waved at the kids and said “Roberta’s getting real mad that someone’s joking about mother (?)”

(I wasn’t in the room so I didn’t hear the comment about me and Rob said I wouldn't get it)

Before I could say anything Rob said “Bro did you really just call me a girl’s name? Are you 12?”

I put my hands up and said okay enough, Hector, stop. He said I’m raising soft kids who can’t take a joke. I said he’s being so effing rude and that he wouldn’t be acting like this if my husband was home. I said that if he wants to still go with us to Colorado in the summer like we were planning, he has to stop NOW or he’s not coming.

This set him off and he said I had no right to do that (yes I do) and that I’m being a controlling yak over Taylor Swift. I said no, fuck Taylor Swift, this is about you being mean to your niece because her dad isn't home.

He said fuck you and good luck next time we have a problem, we’re on our own. He took his Costco chicken and left and I swear he must have immediately gone running to my MIL because she called me to ask for what really happened and sighed a lot. I asked her if I was overreacting and she said she just hopes we can work it out because that trip was all he had to look forward to since he was laid off from work. I HATE causing drama in the family so am I the asshole and I’m out of line?

  
Thanks for all the feedback, I have a path forward. It also needs to be said that some of you are just inventing an entirely new story involving Hector losing his job because his has a bad personality. This is entirely fictional, this didn't happen. His job laid off almost everyone because they are struggling with money and likely won't recover. "
738,1jp095i,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for asking my best friend to stop talking about her celebrity crush,"I know it's a popular topic, so sorry. 

So my best friend (20F) and me (19F) text each other every day but a few months ago she developed a celebrity crush on a guy and ever since that day she just won't stop talking about him. At first, it was a bit overwhelming, but I dealt with it because I used to do the same so I can't complain or it would be hypocritical.  It's just that sometimes, I want to talk about other things or I'm feeling bad and we're having a serious conversation and then she brings him in. 

Yesterday I was telling her I was feeling lonely and  she said ""oh you haven't reacted to my text about me and....."" so I got mad and told her I was going to bed because that was the last thing I wanted to talk about.
 Sometimes I just don't know what to tell her anymore  and I wanna talk about other things, but it always circles back to him. I don't want to sound hypocritical because back then I kinda used to do the same but I was still able to have a serious conversation. 

WIBTA for not answering her texts when she just won't stop talking about him and for telling her to maybe tone it down a bit ? "
739,1jp068k,Not the A-hole,AITA for not befriending the new girl,"In our school, a new girl, we'll call Jane, joined our class recently, and while my friends found her annoying and distant, I felt bad and treated her kindly. She seemed happy but quickly became very touchy, grabbing my shoulders, back, and hair even when I asked her to stop. She also talks over others and doesn’t let people speak. My friend said that she's doing things that friends with a long relationship do.

During a theater project we had, she was added to me and my friend's group. We had to make Mini Stage designs. She kept whining about being uncreative and bored, then took my friend’s cutter and tried to take over her task. When asked to return it, she refused, saying she could do it better. They had a passive-aggressive fight until my friend took the cutter back. Jane then refused to help and kept criticizing our work while laughing as if she meant it harmlessly.

Afterward, my friends insisted we stop talking to her, and I went along. Now, she’s trying to befriend the other girls and occasionally talks to me. I stay friendly but distant and dry. I feel bad since I can see how left out she feels in group projects and gym class, I was like that too. But also don’t like her much, and I wonder if I’m just influenced by my friends."
740,1jp035b,Not the A-hole,AITA for not going to a cebration for my grandma's birthday?,"Ok I don't how start this so please bear with me. Ok so me and my mom got into in argument because I didn't want to go an event for my grandma. For a little context my grandma passed away last year and for her birthday we went out to grave and celebrated and it was nice I had a really good time. Now that I got that out of the way yesterday I was supposed to go and do it again then go out to dinner with my family. But I decided not to go as when we did it last year I loved and didn't want to do again just cuz there were going to be more people there etc. Also I have a lot of school stuff due soon the marking period ends this week also I entered a contest and I need to prepare for that. So I told my mom I didn't want to go and this lead to us getting in to a argument and I feel like all she saw was that I was trying to challenge her or something I don't know. But she said I don't ever do things with my family when that's not true I just like going to do things I don't like to do especially if I know I'm not going to be happy and bring the mood down also she always wants me to do stuff with her but I suggest we do something we almost never do so I just feel like she not seeing where I'm coming from. Then later that day she called me to tell me sister phone had died and that they didn't know where is. I got worried hoping she was ok and then my says this is why I wanted y'all to go together and I feel like she was trying to make me feel bad or guilty and that really hurt my feelings but they ended up finding her and instead of calling me back my mom just texted me saying they had her. Now I'm at school wondering if I was in the wrong, and I feel bad and like I don't want to my mom but at the same time I have an event on Thursday after school my family was supposed to come to but I feel like I don't have the right to ask them to come since I was not there but I want them to come because they have always came it's one of the few times they come to see me from Philly as I usually go to see them. So would I be wrong to ask them to still come or should I just forget about it? And was I the asshole? Sorry if this was bad or hard to understand if you made it this far thanks for reading."
741,1jp02j3,Not enough info,"WIBTA for not going to a childhood friend's wedding, and instead going to a meaningful concert with a current close friend.","I was invited to my childhood friend's wedding. On the same day, there's a meaningful concert that I would rather go to with a current close friend.

Some background:

This childhood friend is someone that I would consider a close friend up until my last couple years of high school. We went to school together, and I would see them at events outside of school (i.e. church). We've known each other since we were toddlers. As we got older, especially when we got our licenses, we didn't hang out a ton outside of school or church. When I moved away for college we didn't really talk at all, and I maybe saw them a handful of times when I would visit home from college. College was almost 10 years ago now.

A couple of years ago, they had dinner with me and my extended family when I visited our hometown. First time I had seen them in probably 5 years. Earlier this year, they texted me and asked for my address for a wedding invitation. I hadn't talked to them since that dinner a couple of years ago. The wedding is across the country in my hometown and would cost around $1000 to fly just for a short weekend. This person was in my wedding party, but I'm not in theirs, and if I'm being honest, I feel like that's less incentive for me going.

On the same day as the wedding, there's a concert coming to the town where I currently live that is a meaningful concert for me, and a bucket list show. I also would be going with a current close friend. We both agreed if this concert ever happened, we would both be going.

With that being said, AITAH?

EDIT: INFO: I have not RSVP'd to the wedding yet.

EDIT: INFO-This person was in your wedding party (way to bury the lede), but you stopped hanging out with them regularly when you were 16? How does that make sense? --> Sorry for not clarifying. This is true. I still went to school with this person and hung out every day during school through graduation (small school 20 people in my class). I got married at 21 (3 years out of high school). The wedding party was large so naturally some ""old friends"" would still be part of it, even if I wasn't as close with them as I had been. I didn't have enough ""adult"" friends yet. Hope that helps.

EDIT: My friend is the groom."
742,1jozw9f,Not the A-hole,AITA for bringing things from my parents' estate home when my wife doesn't want them?,"For over a year, I've (m43) been the main support for my parents (76), managing their rapid health decline. They've moved from a large suburban home in a different state to an apartment near me, and then to two memory care facilities. This week, we fully cleared out their apartment. This has been emotionally exhausting, and I'm bearing the brunt of it. My mom was a hoarder, making the downsizing process immense and overwhelming, My sister(46) lives in Germany, dealing with her own complex life, and my extended family is largely absent, leaving me to handle the logistics and emotional weight of the day-to-day alone.

I've brought home approximately 5% of their belongings: items with sentimental value; potentially useful items; and things we'd likely buy anyway (I'm only firm on the sentimental ones). Only about six items are larger than a banker's box (the largest is an 8ft tall shelf my dad designed and built).

My wife's (42) issues are twofold:

* She immediately criticizes the items, often calling them ""ugly” which feels incredibly hurtful during an already difficult emotional period.
* She dismisses almost all the items outright, showing little to no regard for my interest. She views them as simply ""stuff"" adding to our already cluttered home.

I understand her concern about clutter, especially with our 2-year-old. I acknowledge that I lean towards keeping things more than she does. However, I view this as a gradual and necessary process, not a sudden influx of junk. She feels I'm disregarding her need for our home to be a peaceful sanctuary, and that my attachment to these items is clouding my judgment. I'm trying to preserve meaningful pieces of my childhood and parents' lives, but she sees most items from their home as unwelcome clutter.

My wife lost her mother at 27, so she understands grief. However, she had significantly more family support than I do and didn't have to manage an entire estate. I feel she lacks empathy for the sheer magnitude of the burden I'm carrying. I also understand her perspective, that a home should be peaceful, and that bringing in items from a hoarding environment can be seen as inherently negative. Due to my role with my parents, she is also taking on the larger role with our toddler, increasing her stress.

We had a really bad argument over a desk lamp I brought home 2 days ago. It's the only lamp I wanted. She immediately called it ""ugly,"" said plugging it in was an ""aggressive affront,"" and threatened to throw it out. She backed down, but now we fight about everything. She thinks I'm making this harder than necessary, that it's ""just stuff,"" and that we don't need more things. I feel emotionally exhausted and need time and space to process, while she wants immediate decluttering and a veto of anything coming from my parents. I feel like we are living in two different realities, and she has no room for my reality.

AITA for keeping irreplaceable items (at least for now) that I'm attached to, when the alternative is donate or trash?"
743,1joypil,Not the A-hole,AITA for not shortening my workout for two strangers?,"Yesterday at the gym around 5:30 PM, I started my leg day workout, which is usually the longest of the week. I was using the power rack to do squats, deadlifts, and good mornings, typically taking about 30-40 minutes. There are three power racks, and I was using one of them. I take about 3-minute rests between squat sets since I’m doing heavy weight for low reps.

While I was squatting, two girls, who I’ll call Girl A and Girl B, started waiting behind me. Neither approached me to ask how many sets I had left, but they just hung around. When I finished squatting and began re-racking my weights to prepare for deadlifts, I could tell they assumed I was done. I walked up to Girl A and asked if she was waiting for me to finish. She said yes, so I explained that I still had deadlifts and another movement to do. She responded with “Ugh of course you do…” and I just moved on.

As I set up and began deadlifting, both girls stood nearby, rolling their eyes and acting frustrated, as though I should be shortening my workout for them. I decided to be polite and ask Girl A what she wanted to do. She said squats, so I offered her the nearby squatting area, since I wasn’t using it. She declined, so I kept going with my workout.

Meanwhile, another guy using a different power rack offered the same to Girl B, but she also declined. A group of two women then came up, and the girls complained that they had been waiting for 30 minutes and it was “ridiculous.” I ignored them.

When I finished deadlifting, Girl A moved away to warm up. I approached Girl B and, before I could speak, she looked at me and paused her music, saying, “WHAT??? Hold on, I can’t hear you.” I told her I still had one more movement to do and would need 5-10 more minutes. She seemed upset and responded sarcastically, “Okay, that’s fine. I’ve already been here 30 minutes; what’s another 10?” I shook my head and walked away.

As I started my next movement, I briefly considered shortening it to avoid further conflict, but then decided not to. I didn’t want to reward their rudeness by letting them dictate my workout. I’ve been lifting since 2016 and have always tried to be respectful and kind to others at the gym. When people ask politely, I don’t mind sharing equipment, but the way these girls treated me was unpleasant. I continued my workout as planned because being kind is free, and I wasn’t going to let their behavior disrupt my day.

AITA for continuing my workout despite their rude behavior?"

My stepson (17M) want ""THIS"" whatever this is. He talks about this all the time. How much he wants it. I, he mom & his dad tell them that if he wants this, he needs to do ""THAT"".

He starts doing that, then realizes that doing that will take time & effort. His mom will sometimes offer to pay for some of the way into doing that when applicable. He still wants this and still talks about getting this but doesn't seem in a hurry to do that to get this.

Why I might be butthole?

When my stepson talking about getting or doing this, I remind him of the that he needs to still do. He then gets upset and tell me that I am making him feel bad for reminding him.  
I tell  him, if wanted this badly, he should be concentrating on doing that. I also tell him, if he wants me to stop reminding him about that, he should stop talking about this.

Why I might not be butthole?  
I want my stepson to have all the this he wants, I just want him to put the effort.  
I am reminding him (only when he brings it up first) as a motivation do the thats he needs to do to get the this.

THIS & THAT could be any number of things.

THIS examples: Getting a LEGO set or a car, losing weight, getting a driver's license.  
THAT examples: Saving money, exercising more / eating less, doing his driving classes & tests.

745,1joy2ec,Not the A-hole,AITA for not taking neighbour's parcel?,"Background: I (33M) have one child (5M), for whom I share custody with my ex. I currently live in a 2-bed rental on a quiet street with a row of only 5 other houses along our road. I live on the end of the row.

About 6 months ago, I took in a package delivered for the house at the other end of the row. The package was a heavy box, containing a bag of dog food. Later that evening, the neighbour (38F) came to pick it up. I know she lives alone and offered to carry it for her.

She accepted the offer and thanked me, and as I carried to hers she kept commenting on the fact that I was being a 'gentleman' and it was good to see a 'big strong man' in action. Bit weird but meh, whatever - I'm not that big/strong, although I do go to the gym a few times a week to keep myself in shape. When I got it to hers, she insisted I come in for a glass of water and kept me there for an hour, just chattering on.

The same delivery has come (to me) every month since then. In the evening, she comes to collect, and I carry it over to hers. Each time, she will try to chatter away at me (inside the house, if she can coax me in; or on the doorstep if I can find an excuse not to go in).

Then last month, when she came to collect the package, my son was home with me. I couldn’t take the box up to her as I was making his dinner. She complained that it was too heavy to carry herself and that it would only take a few minutes. I refused, but offered to bring it up later that evening. She pouted and huffed and went home. Half hour later she posted a note through the door with her mobile number on it and asked me to message when I could bring it.

I had to feed my son, give him his bath, play with him, put him to bed… Once I’d done all that, I finally messaged her. She didn’t reply until the next day, telling me she had been tired and fallen asleep. Then a few hours later she sent through a long, rambling TIRADE. She told me I should have helped, that I was selfish, that I obviously hadn’t wanted to help her as I could have asked her to stay with my son while I carried it (fair point, though it just didn’t occur to me in that moment), and that if I really wanted to help her I would have messaged her earlier. This was all sprinkled with some very colourful language.

I was in complete shock. I apologised and said I would bring it to her that evening, which I then did. 

Last week, the day came again for that parcel to arrive. And this time I refused to take it. 

She came banging on the door later in the evening and screamed at me for not taking the package, that she now had to find a way to get it from the company depot and that it was going to cost her a fortune.

Now everyone along the street knows about it. Another neighbour (58M) has made it clear that he thinks I’m the AH and has threatened to complain to my landlord about my “un-neighbourly behaviour”. I really don’t think I’m in the wrong here. AITA?"
746,1joxw3p,Everyone Sucks,AITA husband called me racist,"AITA we were listening to my husband's YouTube playlist in the car yesterday.A song came on, and it was in a different language. I want to say Ukrainian, but I'm not sure.

I said ""is this even english, i don't want to listen to it, i can't understand it."" and I changed the song.

Then he escalated the situation by saying ""i don't understand spanish, so all Mexican's need to go back to Mexico"", and he called me a 'Racist' 


So I can't change a song i don't understand, or that makes me Racist? That's too much. I have a right to change a song. Am I Racist if I change an English song that I don't want to listen to? That makes no sense.

Soooo does that mean I can put on ANY song of any language, and he's forced to listen to it, and if he doesn't, I can call him a racist? I doesn't make sense.

ETA: he is a very extreme liberal.
I'm Hispanic and speak English and Spanish. "
747,1joxd6k,Asshole,AITA for going behind my husbands back and agreeing to count calories for my son?,"
Me and my husband decided to post this disagreement online.

Our sons (20M, 23M) have body image issues and they both exercise. My youngest thinks he is overweight our oldest thinks he’s underweight, “Cutting” and “Bulking” respectively. They have convinced their sister (17F) to join in but she is not as neurotic as them.

We don’t agree this is healthy, but they are becoming adults and are allowed to make their own decisions. (A lot later than we “Became” adults but I blame the economy and job market for that. It’s hard for them to get a consistent source of income) They pay for their gym membership and food. Not us.

We do, however, deal with the mess. They don’t slob and leave it all out for us to discover but I occasionally discover bits of seasoning or tomato paste on our tables and floors that pass them by. They insist they do clean up but seeing this in my home makes me feel insecure 

It culminated two weeks ago when our youngest son accidentally spilt onion powder across our table, sink, and floor. I ran downstairs after hearing a loud THUD, was incredibly angry, and banned him from touching anything in the kitchen indefinitely. When my husband returned he escalated it and said he wasn’t allowed to have his siblings ook anything for him, (Which they offered to do), I would have to cook his meals, and went on about how he was insane for counting calories and measuring food.

I agree with my husband, but don’t feel we have a right to dictate their eating habits. I banned him from my kitchen. If his siblings, who were not, wanted to help him out that’s their choice. I texted my youngest saying while I decide how much he eats, I would make he likes and use his food scale to measure it to the gram so that he is at least informed. This put him at ease.

A few days ago my husband walked in on me doing that, I see no reason to hide it from him as we all use his food scale. I told him I was making our sons food, he seemed incredibly upset. Later that night clarifying I went behind his back.

I told him that’s exactly what he did to me. We agree this is bad for their health but not on how much we ought to intervene. 

Yesterday we had a calm discussion on this, and gave our children an ultimatum. Our youngest is still not allowed to prepare his own food for the time being, but I will make what he wants and measure it. He can make requests and I will adjust accordingly. We have somewhat restricted our daughter and oldest’s kitchen privileges but they can cook for youngest within those lines, and can make requests from me. To offload the stress of always counting themselves.

My husband convinced them to take up martial arts, he feels if they want to obsess over calories, they ought have a reason to.

Main point: Am I wrong for going behind my husband’s back despite him going behind mine?"
748,1joujzp,Not the A-hole,AITA for fighting and cancelling plans because of my family's different opinions?,"I(21f) am from India. And well apparently here we believe that the sick shouldn't know that they are sick because that will kill them before the illness will.

My mother's uncle has cancer, 4th stage and he's like really sick. But no one has told him that he has cancer. So I asked my mother why does he not know? Like he deserves to know why he is so sick right?

My mother behaved awfully rude because we have had this conversation before. So I told her that he still has the right to know. Like if I was sick I would want to know why my health is deteriorating.

Things went downhill when my father joined in and he said that if he ever gets cancer, I shouldn't tell him because that would be the only thing he will think about.

So I said ok that's your opinion, it's fine but you don't know if that's the uncle's opinion also. He told me that I have become too all knowing and I argue too much.

The only thing I could do was cry because of their behaviour for a single opinion of mine. We got into a very bad fight and I cancelled our plans with family friends. Which caused another chaos and my family is still telling me that I am wrong for having such an opinion and I am trying to kill her uncle by giving him news about his cancer. 

I feel guilty now and shouldn't have acted the way I did. Pulling down his moral wasn't my intention. 


So am I the asshole for cancelling our plans and fighting? "
749,1jos1cy,Not the A-hole,AITAH for kicking my cousin out of my engagement party,"
So, I (25F) recently got engaged, and my fiancé (27M) and I decided to host a small engagement party at my parents' house. I invited a few close friends and family, but I didn’t invite my cousin, who has a history of being rude and disrespectful at family gatherings. 

A few years back, she made a hurtful comment about my weight at a family reunion, which really upset me. Since then, she’s continued to make snide remarks about my life choices and relationships, often joking at my expense. I’ve tried to talk to her about her behavior before, but she never takes it seriously and just laughs it off.

On the day of the party, I was excited to celebrate with my loved ones. My cousin shows up uninvited with a couple of her friends, acting like she owns the place. I was shocked and felt uncomfortable, especially since I’d made it clear she wasn’t welcome. When I asked her to leave, she got upset and started making a scene, saying I was being a snob and that family should always stick together. 

Now, my family is divided. Some think I was right to stand my ground, while others believe I should have let her stay since it’s family. AITA for kicking her out?"
750,1jorewz,Asshole,AITA or am I just a bad friend?,"AITA or am I just a bad friend

My friend, who is 16, and I, who am 18, have been friends for over three years now, soon to be four! 
However, there has always been one incident that comes up few weeks. He and I met three years back when he had shifted to my apartment complex, and, we just clicked with each other. It was the deepest I had bonded with someone back then. Over a month, we became best friends. He meant a lot to me, but I always knew that we would have to part ways as he had only come because of his dad’s transfer to my city. I was afraid that he and I wouldn’t ever meet again. 

Eventually his dad got another transfer, and he had to leave. I was overcome with loss and grief. For the first few days, I just couldn’t get my mind off him not being there. I was truly engulfed by depressive thoughts. I wanted to move on, and I couldn’t keep moping over him, so surely not texting him would be the right move, right? How can you be attached to a person you no longer talk? In hindsight, my reasoning was wrong, but it was a decision I had to make. From then, I started dry texting him, leaving him on seen, and not responding to his texts. It wasn’t working; he persisted. After weeks of him trying to maintain a connection and me trying to sever it, I took the extreme step. I told him that I didn’t want to be friends with him and that I found new friends since he left. I lied, and he still sent texts, but not as frequent. I almost believed that he didn’t care either, and I resolved to not befriend him ever again.

Months later, I went to a mutual friend’s party, to whom he had remarked that he was glad that he left. That made the realisation hit.  I hadn’t moved on. All I had done was cast aside the one friend who cared for me relentlessly, at my worst and at my best. I had lost the one real thing I had. I missed him, terribly. So, I tried to rebuild our friendship. It was more than merely successful. In less than a month, we had built a friendship deeper and stronger than it was last time. I hadn’t told him how I felt, and I made it a point to always put it across the board so he always knew that I cared for him. He did too. But we never discussed at length the months-long stretch where we hadn’t talked or texted, that was until a recent group call. 


He, I, and our friend got onto a group call, and she narrated how he acted during the time where he and I hadn’t uttered a word to each other. She told me how he was saddened and how he was frustrated, frustrated enough to use my name as an insult for icing people out. Weirdly enough, I was pleased. We talked later, of course, and he revealed to me that he was more so mad that he had to put in effort while I didn’t. We made up and kept talking. Soon, I noticed how he wouldn’t ever tell me how he felt about anything that happened in his life. I couldn’t help but be bothered by it. I always tell him how I feel, but he doesn’t. I think it has to do with me not talking to him for those long months. AITA?"
751,1jordiv,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving early and probably selling the car for less value,"Situation is the following. I meet two friends while doing an work holiday year in a different country. We worked together and lived in the same hostel and bought a car together. The plan was the two guys leave at the end of march and I stay in the country till early May. We all payed the same price for the car and used it to make a 4 month road-trip throughout the country. 

Afterwards the guys left and I stayed behind to work and sell the car till I leave as well. We wanted to sell the car for nearly the same price we bought it at, as we did some repairs and put some more money in it. After no one wanted to buy the car and we had it online for nearly two weeks we went lower with the price. 

Now came the problem. I didn’t find any work so I’m probably gonna leave three weeks earlier and have to sell the car off for a way lower price. We started selling it for 3k and then went down to 2800 then to 2500 and are now down to 2300 (the car was online for over a month by this point). If no one is buying the car till the end of the week I probably have to sell it to a dealership and they will pay even less than 2300. 

Now I told my friends that I plan on leaving early and to word it kindly they snapped. Told me it’s not their fault I don’t get a job and I’m an egoistic asshole for now wanting to sell the car off to a dealership and stuff. One even told me that I would have to pay the difference to him if I sell it off for way cheaper. 

For once I can understand their anger, we all payed for it and it’s shitty that I want to leave early and sell the car for cheaper than we thought. On the other hand I don’t understand what another three weeks would do if we’ve been trying to sell it for over a month now to no avail. It’s not my fault the cars not selling and I loose money as well by selling it off for that cheap. I mean that’s what I would have to do anyway if it hasn’t been sold by the end of April. 

Could you guys give your ten cents and tell me that I’m wrong/right.

**tldr; bought a car with two friends, two friends left country while I was supposed to stay for another month behind. Now I’m leaving three weeks earlier and having to sell car off for cheaper than anticipated** "
752,1joqw8a,Not the A-hole,AITA for not inviting my cousin on a camping trip?," Last year my cousin (m27) got into a verbal altercation, on a camping trip, with my crush (m26) who is now my fiancé. My cousin has been a really good guy in the past but also has built himself a reputation for being mean. I love him but he crossed a line when he decided too secretly wait for Alex (fake name/crush) too be by himself too yell at him too leave and, how he doesn’t deserve to have my family and I as his friends. My crush ends up leaving that night saying he had a work emergency. He didn’t tell us my cousin asked him too leave. My cousin tells us the next morning what happened after he’s gone. I was heartbroken because I wanted too really hangout with Alex and my cousin knew that too. During the argument, my cousin shared with me how he told Alex “I almost liked you and now I feel bad that my cousin has feelings for you.” This was last year and he never apologized too Alex. My fiancé says he’s moved on and he doesn’t mind him coming but I do. I don’t want that energy around my relationship or myself. I love my cousin but for him too bully someone I love is out of line. My brother says I’m overreacting and I should be okay with my cousin coming on trips with my love and I. If our cousin was mean too his girlfriend I’m sure the story would be different. Anyways, AITA for not inviting my cousin on a camping trip? "
753,1joqqk0,Not the A-hole,AITA for not paying my friend back for something I never asked for?,"This happened like a week ago and it’s still awkward. My friend and I were at the mall just walking around and we stopped by one of those little skincare booths. The lady was doing free hand scrubs or whatever, and I was just standing there letting her try it on me because it smelled nice. The friend was super into it though, asking a million questions.

I said I wasn’t buying anything and even stepped away a little, but while I was looking at a display, the friend ended up buying two of the scrubs. They were like $35 each. Cool, whatever. But then as we were leaving she handed me one and was like, “Here, I got one for you too.”

I literally said, “Wait what? Why?” and she just shrugged and went, “I know you liked it, it’s no big deal.” I said thanks but also told her she didn’t have to do that.

Now fast forward to yesterday, she texts me like, “Hey can you send me $35 for that scrub when you get a chance?” I was confused and said, “I thought you were treating me,” and she goes, “Well I didn’t think I’d have to pay for both. I assumed you’d Zelle me later.”

Ummm what?? I didn’t ask for it. I didn’t agree to it. And she literally said “it’s no big deal.”

I told her nicely that I’m not paying for something I didn’t want in the first place. Now she’s acting like I’m taking advantage of her and says she wouldn’t have bought it if she knew I wouldn’t pay her back.

So now I feel weird. I didn’t want it. I didn’t ask. But I also don’t want to seem ungrateful.

AITA?"
754,1joqlst,Not the A-hole,AITAH for telling my sister to stop trauma dumping to win arguments,"This one is kinda long, sorry bout that. Me (19) and my sister (24) are fairly close, it hasn't always been like this though. Long story short I guess you could say I was a golden child, I have various chronic conditions which resulted in me and my sister being raised fairly differently. We also lived separately for a decent chunk of my childhood. She lived with my mum and I stayed with my dad, we'd visit eachother every once in a while. Though we we sorta close when I was young as I got older I was fairly certain she didn't like me up untill the big pandemic, we quarantined together and learned we were quite similar and have been friends since. There's just one problem though, she can't apologize without being petty.

She has this sorry but mentality. Her apologies always sound a little like ""Sorry I was mean to you but u were worse to me when we were younger."" The statement itself isn't a lie as I was a brat, I hated being sick and that caused me to lash out and lie. Sometimes my actions would directly or indirectly get her implicated. The thing is she'd get harsher punishment as she doesn't get golden child privilege. I'm aware of this and I do feel bad, but when we became friends we agreed to leave out our past. This isn't to be petty but she was also not I nice kid to be around, there's a reason I thought she didn't like me. She just can't seem to leave my past behind but has no problem leaving behind hers. If we have an argument I might win she's trauma dumping midway through even when it's unrelated. She always finds a way to bring in her rough childhood. I could be saying stop making fun of my lisp and she'd say, well I was bullied for mine.

The point is I always end up feeling guilt tripped and apologize, heck most of the time idek what the original arguments were about. Yesterday she did it again and I got sick of it. I told her "" I love you but at this point I'm tired of being your friend. Stop bringing up your trauma to guilt trip me into saying you're right"", I called her manipulative and told her she's not a tragic novel protog. I sent a msg that said ""You stop doing this or we stop talking, I don't wanna be friends with someone that makes me feel like trash"" I also said some other things I'm not so proud of in the heat of the moment. She's just always bringing up my past I've moved on from to make me feel like a bad person. Something we agreed to leave in the past for the sake of our friendship, I think I was just tired of being her emotional punching bag.

The point is it's been over 24hrs and I've cooled off, I haven't gotten a response yet though. Normally we text everyday, even after I said all this we are close, and after cooling off I do feel bad. I rlly do wanna stay friends, I didn't mean it when I said I didn't want to. Maybe there was a better way to handle this? Give it to me straight, should I go apologize? AITAH?"

They sometimes leave me alone at home for a few days if some work comes up. A similar instance happened and i was alone for 3 days. They came back life went as normal now a few days back my aunt was removing her nail polish and the remover was not working. She automatically assumed that i had something to do with it. However she put it to my mother camly and she talked to me
 I ofc refused because how the fuck can i be responsible for a remover refusing to remove nail polish? I told her i had nothing to with it. My aunt also accused me of going around snooping in her stuff which I ofc did not. Now yesterday I went around 4 shops to buy a nail polish remover but did not find it and it was getting late and shops were closing so i went back home. After dinner she asked for my nail polsih remover and i gave it to her but very little was left which i was unaware of. She started looking at me with anger and i said in what i believe was a calm tone but both of them said otherwise that its okay I'll go and buy it tmrw. She flared up at this comment idk why and started yelling and saying that i was the one who fiddled with her things and whatnot. I very calmly replied that i did nothing and ofc why would she listen to me,she again started shouting and i just walked off up to my room. She continued shouting which i obvuously ignored. At night my mother came to the room and told me i am in the wrong for talking back but i told her i said it very calmly. She said no, it sounded rude.

During 9th grade she changed schools and we didn’t text much (Thats my fault as I’m not the greatest and remembering to text or contact people), however since then we have gotten super close again and TMI no longer exists between us. Over the last few weeks maybe we even months, I’ve noticed she hardly texts me unless I text her, but when we do text I make sure to ask if shes okay and if she needs help (She has had a pretty rough year with things I wont discuss). Our conversations aren’t dry and we have a good chat. I also ask her to hangout often as she is one of my only friends atm, but she says she’s swamped and stressed with schoolwork. Normally I would completely understand and even offer to help study, but then I see her post with her boyfriend (They go to the same school and hangout daily) who she hangs out with out side of school almost daily. I texted her today about this observation and she hit me with the “Im super busy with school and im so stressed” again. I so desperately want to point out that I also have assignments that are due, I’ve recently gotten out of an abusive relationship, am currently getting bullied constantly (I dont actually know the specific reason but am now isolated and hate school), my dads just been diagnosed with cancer (which she would know if she ever asked how I was going) yet I still manage to make an effort in our friendship, texting and checking in on her and offering to help.

757,1joojl7,Not the A-hole,AITA for deciding not to invite my husband’s family to my kid’s birthday party after they called her a mistake?,"Me (25F) and my husband (26M) have been together for five years. We had our daughter pretty early on (she’s 4 now) and yeah, she wasn’t planned, but we were happy and I have no regrets at ALL. His family, not so much. They’ve always been kinda cold towards me and honestly, I've noticed that they don’t treat our daughter the same as the other grandkids.

Last weekend, we were at his moms house for a late dinner, and she and my FIL were talking about my husband as a teenager. My mother in law than proceeded to joke in *front* of my daughter saying how he used to be so carefree and go with the flow ""before he had to settle down so fast."" Then she added ""I bet he wished he had more time before jumping into the dad life with an oopsie baby.""

I was pissed.

We ended up leaving soon after that since it was getting late anyways, and that night as I tucked my daughter into bed she asked me what an oopsie baby was. I felt heartbroken for her and basically explained that sometimes people have kids by accident, but that doesn't make her any less special.

After I put her to bed I ranted to my husband, saying I don't want his MIL around our daughter if she's going to be saying stuff like that. The last thing I want is for my baby girl to be questioning whether or not she's wanted.

I said I don't want my family in law at her fifth birthday party next month and I won't be sending them an invite until they apologize for making things awkward. My husband says I'm overreacting over a small comment and I need to relax and not make this a thing.He argued saying I shouldn't overreact a comment she made when she was tired. He told me I'm not allowed to uninvite \*his\* family, especially over this. 

Am I overreacting? Should I just suck it up and let them come to the party and risk my daughter hearing more harmful things? I'm honestly really upset but I feel like I'm the only person who's mad so idk what to do. AITA?"

760,1jonue6,Not the A-hole,AITA for lowkey contributing to my ex-friend's social isolation?,"This is going to be a long one so please bare with me and english isn't my first language. 
 
I (23, female) have a friend, Anya (also 23 not her real name), who I’ve known since high school. Anya struggled with body image issues. We supported her— helping her with tasks, encouraging her health journey, and offering advice on relationships. Despite her challenges, she maintained a positive outlook. 
But as her confidence grew, like a switch, she became obnoxious. She started treating us more like personal assistants. She’d ask us to do things for her—small or big—and sulk if we said no. I hated confrontation, so I usually just complied. 

The biggest mistake I made was agreeing to room with Anya in college. I was struggling financially and thought splitting rent would help. Although my family was financially stable, my course was expensive. We were friends, so living together seemed like a good idea. But it wasn’t.  Living with Anya for five months was exhausting. We set up a system for chores, but I ended up doing everything. Even when she did help, she’d act like I was making her do it. I was too afraid of controntation to say no and just dealt with it. 

Even as classmates, it wasn’t the bonding experience I expected. She’d leave me behind to hang out with her new friends but would still brag to others about how we were lifelong friends. It didn’t make sense to me. Anya also asked me for help with schoolwork, and if I was busy and said no, she sulked. But when I needed help, she wasn’t there. 

Things got worse. My mental health was already bad, but living with her made it worse. She’d always say, “I helped you, why can’t you do the same?” which made me feel like everything came with a price. I stopped accepting her help, and when I refused, she would get annoyed and throw everything she did for me in my face. I kept track of all the things she “helped” me with and paid her back immediately to stop her from holding it over me. 

Her favorite line? ""If you need anything, just ask! I’m happy to help a friend."" But then a day later, it would be ""I did this for you, you should be grateful."" 

After all that, for months, I noticed people started distancing themselves from Anya. She didn’t seem to notice, but I did. I spoke to a few classmates, and they shared their frustrations about Anya’s entitled behavior. 
She already had a bad reputation but my  petty self worsened it by telling them about my experience with as her friend for years. Of her as a student, a friend, a ""leader"". 

For the next two years of college, Anya was isolated. I realize I might’ve contributed to her isolation.

When I mean local grocery store it means I can walk from my house to the store in under 10 mins. None of us own a car to drive to the store so we needed to walk it. My cousin and aunt own a wagon for groceries so we brought it with us instead of holding all the bags. The grocery shopping went fine. My sister and cousin were craving Subway so we went into Subway next to the grocery store with the wagon that had some food, about 10  items like bolillos(bread), some sodas, etc. Immediately we came in with the wagon the workers saw. My cousin and I ordered subs.  The workers were speaking Spanish so we ordered in Spanish as well. The workers saw the bread (bolillos) and started to make jokes about taking the bread and making it into a sub. Rough translating as I forgot what they exactly said “ I can take that bread and add hams and cheese to it if you want that” and he ask his coworker “hey can we take those bread and make it into a sub” he responds with “ yeah we can make them into salvadoran bolillos.” They stopped with the joke and he did the regular things as a subway worker does. Like asking me if I want the sub toasted stuff like that. Mind you, none was laughing, only them. My aunt has bad hearing so she was kinda listening and not but my sister wasn’t listening at all. At this point we’re at the cashier. I told him to add my cousin's sub to mine as well because we decided to share a six foot long sub together(we got 2). My sister gets up and says my name “ hey am going to pay” He asks me “ are you going to pay or the fat girl” I was in shock I didn’t know what to say I stayed silent and I said “ she going to pay” I felt so uncomfortable that I left the cashier and went to the table we’re going to eat food and let my sister take over for me. I didn’t say anything about what happened during the time we were eating. I didn’t say anything in that 5 min walk even though I was thinking about it. I didn’t say anything to anyone when we were organizing the food into its place. I said something 2~3 hours later. 

When I told my family what happened, they were mad at me. 
For not speaking up and defending my sister 
For bringing it up
  My mom said because I wanted to make fun of my sister that’s why I told her. But I don’t think that was the case (I don’t know what I brought up, I think I told them because I wanted to bring light to the situation and I didn’t find time.
   My aunt and cousin said I shouldn’t say it 2-3 hours later. I should have said it in the moment so they could have said something. "
762,1jonneu,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my MIL she needs to back off?,"I 28(f) have 3 children, 9(m), 5(m) and almost 1(f). My two boys are from a previous relationship and my husband is the father of our daughter. For context, we live with MIL due to her needing help with bills. I love my MIL, she's been a great support system and loves the kids but she has an issue with interfering a little too much. 

Whenever there is a problem with the older kids ( them not listening, talking back, doing something they know they shouldn't be) she needs to get involved. Even before my husband or I try to take care of the issue ourselves she trys to be the parent. When we do correct them she still needs to always put her 2 cents in and also tells us what she would do instead. We've also caught her not listening to us as far as rules we've set in place and things we've asked her not to do. For example, we've asked MIL not to place our daughter in MIL's bed for a nap because she can wake up at any moment and decided to crawl off but she continues to do so. That's just one example. 

We continuously tell her we are the parents and need to be the ones to parent first, unless we aren't around to do so at the moment. She also does little things like calls our daughter ""her baby"", has seen something my daughter is wearing and has said ""I have something just like that, I could put it on and we could match"" has said how much my daughter resembles her and she even mentioned to me one day how she ""accidently"" told my daughter to ""come to mommy"" when she was on the floor crawling.

 The last straw was when she had our daughter on her bed and my husband was standing in the doorway of her room, our daughter was crawling around and got a little too close to the edge for my husband's comfort, so he reacted and reached his hands out and slightly launched himself to the bed. MIL started yelling at him about how ""she's fine, I was right here"" etc and my husband told her she's his daughter and it made him uncomfortable. MIL then continued saying "" how do you think you survived as a baby"" etc. 

I lost my cool, I heard everything from the kitchen and stormed to her room, grabbed my daughter and told her she needed to back off and stop playing a parent role, she's not my children's parents, she's their grandma, and if we're not comfortable with something she needs to respect that. It's been super tense in the house the last couple of days,AITA? "
763,1jonmnf,Asshole,AITA for flirting for food after 8 years of giving him the cold shoulder?,"I'm using my friends account because I'm not on Reddit. 

I 34(F) bartend at a local bar in a remote area. We get the same people everyday. One local guy is kind of a man whore and the dating pool here is so abysmal that he's basically hooked up with everyone in town, but whatever that's not my business. He relentlessly hits on me and tells me he's madly in love with me every single day, though and I always roll my eyes and turn him down. There are hardly any restaurants here and basically all of them except for the one I work at are closed for the winter.

He is from Mexico and I love Mexican food but the closest Mexican restaurant is over an hour away. The other night he offered to bring me homemade tamales from his tía and my stomach overrides my brain so I said ""yes please!!""

He ended up bringing chicken and ribs instead but that was good enough for me!! The next night I jokingly asked him what's for dinner tonight and he brought me some delicious Tinga! 

He has not taken the hint in the last eight years and I have realized and accepted that this is my reality for the forseeable future, possibly for the rest of my life, so AITA if I give him a glimmer of hope and send him that Snapchat message asking him ""what's for dinner tonight?"" because I know he will continue to bring me food. It is not only benefitting me, but also my friend/coworker who has had to deal with his drunk ass everyday for the last eight years as well.




Edit: Just to clarify, he is bringing the food to my job that he frequents multiple times a day while my friend and I are working. Also, I have never flirted with him once in eight years and tell him on a daily basis that I am not interested and never will be. The only thing my messages say is ""What's for dinner tonight?"" I only mentioned his promiscuity to explain why I would never be interested. I don't want to hook up with someone who has banged half my customers. #toocomplicated"
764,1jonien,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I told my mom she can't move in because I'm moving somewhere else?,"Now a bit of context before everyone grabs their pitchfork and torches. 

My mom (50+F) had a bunch of medical problems in 2024, she had 4 strokes and lost both of her feet because of her diabetes, I've been her sole caregiver since 2023. 

We got evicted and lived in a RV, that's when my mom lost her feet and had her strokes. I've had to take care of her while juggling a full time job and being a full time student (Working on getting my GED and degree) 

Recently at the start of the year my mom went to a physical rehabilitation center, she constantly blows up my phone and my father's, she's constantly trailing off and sometimes completely dropped the conversation when someone walks into her room, or she asks for things constantly knowing well that I'm struggling to keep things a float, asking for me to buy her vapes or to come see her right then and there even calling me during class and work, I've been working on having her work on her disability and recently I just found out she's been neglecting it so bad they had to reject her and we have to start ALL over again. (Over a year or filing for disability and food stamps, wasted)

I got home from work today and my mom calls me and tells me that she's being kicked out of her rehabilitation center in 3 days because her insurance won't pay for her stay anymore and she needs a place to go and someone to get her, I'm still trying to figure out where me and my dad are going to go because we have to move out of the apartment I'm staying in soon. I want to tell her no she can't stay because she's going to get worse, but I know she'll start crying and it breaks my heart. 

But I'm about to be homeless and I don't even know where I'm going. Plus I feel like I'm going to get mad at her more then happy to see her, she constantly asks for stuff even knowing I'm broke even when we lived in the RV she'd wake me up just to ask if my daily pay hit so I can buy her smokes or soda, not groceries, not snacks, not even booze. Just smokes and soda. I'm just now finally getting into the habit of waiting 2 weeks for my next check instead of using daily pay every time I work.

765,1jon1kh,Not the A-hole,AITA: my cousin moved into our house and my parents expect me to act like her servent,"ok, so i (f18) am a senior in high school, and my cousin (f12) just moved from india with her parents. i live with my younger brother (15) and two parents in a house big enough for us, but with seven people now, it’s getting cramped. for the first two months after they moved in, she slept in my room, and her parents stayed in our guest room. for context, my room is the smallest in the house. we made a makeshift bed for her, but it eventually got to the point where i couldn’t even move around in my own room.  

eventually, her parents got jobs and relocated to another state but allowed her to stay with us since she had already enrolled in school here and wanted her to finish the year. i've really tried my best to accommodate all of her needs and help her with her homework. i constantly asked what she was learning in india so i could compare it with the u.s. curriculum and teach her what she needed to know. i helped her study for tests, write emails to teachers, explained homework, and helped pick out her clothes when needed. i moved her clothes from my closet to the guest room and tidied up so my parents wouldn’t have to worry about the room being messy after my uncle and aunt left.  

now, the issue is that my parents expect me to drop everything and help her whenever she has a problem. i don’t understand why they don’t ask my brother, or why she doesn’t just look up the answers to her questions herself, like how to solve a math problem or who the 12th president of the u.s. was. i don’t get why i have to help her write notes or memorize flashcards. i liked talking to her at first, i haven’t seen her for six years, but it’s getting exhausting. i can’t pretend i want to sit in her room for hours every day talking about things i don’t care about.  

so, i stopped. i started locking my door, putting on earbuds when i study, leaving for volleyball practice earlier, and going out with friends more, especially since it’s my last year of high school. i tell them i’m busy with college stuff, but it’s reached a point where my parents are noticing and have had a talk with me. they say i’m acting antisocial and making her feel left out. they say i don’t go out of my way to treat her kindly, which i did. but i seriously can’t keep this facade going. it’s my last year of high school, and i don’t want to keep telling my friends i can’t hang out because my cousin is bored.  

my brother comes home from basketball practice, does his homework, and plays video games with his friends, and no one says anything to him. the thing is, i don’t even think she wants to talk to me that much either—she locks her door, watches tv on her ipad, and calls her friends and parents occasionally. so i don’t even feel like i’m doing anything wrong, but my parents think otherwise. sorry if this feels like i’m rambling (i am), but i’m just so frustrated that my parents think my whole life now has to revolve around my 12-year-old cousin.

766,1joll03,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my husband he can't bring one of the cars unless he asks permission from my parents?,"A little background: We live in one property with my parents and siblings. It's basically a compound with my parents and unmarried sibs in one house, married sibling and family in another and my family in another house. But garage is shared. We have several cars but most of them belong to my parents. Married sib has one car from when she was still single, her husband has one but sold it to get a family car. I had one from when I was single, but sold it when my family ran into some financial troubles (my husband's doing)...so we basically borrow from my parents.

So today, my husband is going to have a meeting after lunch and a birthday dinner to go to. Being my day off of work, he knew that I had plans today with the kids (11yo and 3yo) and taking one of the cars with us. He declared he will also bring a car (one of the cars). I told him he should ask permission from mom or dad, which in my opinion, is just right since they aren't ours. I mean, as their child, I still ask permission whenever I use one of the cars.
He got pissed. And even had the attitude in front of my mom. 

Edited to add: He was mumbling something and gave a pretty final, ""OK! BUT I AM GOING TO BRING A CAR!""

He hasn't asked my parents yet if he can bring one of the cars today, and I'm guessing he's waiting for the last minute like literally when he's going out the door.

I sometimes feel like I might be TA but his attitude about the whole thing ever since he started driving (like 3 years) is just off and my mind always screams he's TA. "
767,1jol5el,Everyone Sucks,"AITAH For Telling My Friend To Go To Hell, Apologizing, Then Yelling At Him For Sending Things To People Without My Permission","I am writing this to get an opinion not to prove a point or something.

I want to start off by saying I'm autistic and I don't have social cues. I know I can't use it as an excuse and typically if I don't get the response I was expecting I ask questions.

Me and A have a fuck you fuck you kind of realationship if you understand that. We joke around and make fun of each other.

We were emailing a couple of days ago and I said something along the lines of you need to go to hell.

I asked a friend about it after I got a response I wasn't expecting. He explained it very well and I wrote a lengthy apology to A.

However A wrote back to me, ""you need to get over yourself"". At this point I wrote back to him saying that he could've just accepted and we could've gotten over it. His response was, ""well I didn't say I didn't accept it"".

From there I just stopped talking to him. Because he started lying to our mutual friends.

About two days later my friend L asked why we weren't talking. I told her I apologized (she knew the beginning situation) and he told me in his first response, ""stop using autism as an excuse and get over it"". I know that this was probably a miscommunication, but I told her that as well as that it was most likely a miscommunication. She acted like she understood, and I told her to please not insert herself into the position of the peacemaker.

But going against my wishes she tried to fix it. She started asking why he told me to get over my autism. After she did that, L told more people about it.

A restarted the chat with the apology. He told me to stop lying to people. I told him what happened and of course he thought I was lying.

We cut off ties finally and he decided to go back to the chat and share it with about 20 people. Those people told him to stop sharing it and he refused. This typically wouldn't have been a big deal but I put very personal information in my apology that I don't want a ton of people to know.

Eventually he brought it back up in person and said ""I'm not going to stop sharing it until you apologize"". I finally lost it, I did apologize and just because he didn't accept it that doesn't mean I didn't accept it.

I yelled at him for his idiotic behavior and how I knew what I dis was wrong and how I apologized multiple times.

So AITAH for yelling at A after he shared personal things?"
768,1joklso,Everyone Sucks,AITA for not letting my child's father see her until he pays child support?,"So like the headline states am I the asshole? This dude owes almost 19k in cs and I use to let him pick her up and drop her off to school (not everyday just once a week) but I think I am going to block him from her ipad so he won't come anymore. My child has an amazing life with just me and I make decent money for just us two. Ofc the help will be great if I had it but I don't. So now I plan on blocking him to have communication with her via ipad because I feel like it and because he shouldn't be able to just do whatever he feels like it. 

Btw there is no visitation ordered by the courts. 
So I'm not violating any mandatory visitation rights. 

Edit: I know I didn't give much info on the original post so here is more. Child is 8 years old , I took him to court for child support when she was 4 after him not wanting to contribute financially for her. By the way he never showed up to court to cooperate. I have her on my health insurance, I pay for all her expenses including extracurricular activities. He comes in and out of her life when he pleases. He talks to her via her ipad. He doesn't call/txts her everyday just when he wants. Last year he only made an attempt to see her maybe like 4 times. He has been inconsistent with her since she was 2 years old. When he does see her he only spends 20-30 minutes with her because then she wants to be dropped off. Sometimes my daughter ignores his calls and I ask why and she just states that she doesn't want to talk to him. He gives her junk food when he sees her because I don't really give her that kind of food. He doesn't even know what size she wears or the names of the teachers that she has.  He's absent most of her life wouldn't that be emotional abuse for her to have to deal with that?"
769,1jojifw,Not the A-hole,AITA for already practicing an audition piece before it was given?,My high school has 4 bands in total and the top two bands require auditions while the bottom two do not. We recently received our audition pieces and I was surprised to see that our etude was a piece I learned over the summer. The piece is from one of the “Rubank Advanced” books and over the summer I learned the whole book solely for the purpose of practice and not to try and give myself an advantage against my peers. The piece is only about 20 measures long and we are given 2 months to learn it along with some scales. I told my friends about how excited I was that I knew the piece and I might be able to get into the top band and they all replied that I should be given a new piece because it isn’t fair to everyone else. I felt bad and even talked to my directors about it and they said that I don’t have an advantage because I didn’t know that the piece was going to be given I just happened to practice it. Even after telling this to my friends they still agree that it isn’t fair to the other people auditioning and that I’m a selfish asshole for thinking that it is. Am I the asshole?
770,1jojgxw,No A-holes here,AITA for telling my roommate to stop cooking fish at home?,"I (25F) asked my roommate (26M) to stop cooking fish at home. It has gotten out of hand. To the point where our entire house is saturated with salmon aroma for days after. It’s important to note that my roommate and I are very good friends and have zero other living issues, but this one. 

We’ve been living together for a year now and it’s gotten to a point where salmon specifically is his main source of protein. He buys it in bulk and regularly cooks it in the oven and microwaves it on a weekly basis. As you can imagine, our home smells like a fish market. I, personally, cannot stand the smell of fish. However, if he was cooking fish even once to twice a week - I’d have no issues. We are after all roommates not committed partners. 

Now we rise to the AITA in this situation. I started slowly making comments about the smell to drop a hint to which he laughs and will say “do you want me to starve?”. Yet, one year later and I still live in a fish market. I can’t take it any longer and told him to please stop cooking and microwaving fish on a consistent weekly basis. He argued that me asking him to stop eating fish isn’t fair especially since it’s his favorite food. From this conversation, he argued that he even microwaves his leftover fish at work and no one complains (I was sure to let him know that he is the talk of the office because it’s a cardinal rule to never microwave fish at work). 

Now I may be the AH because I’m trying to dictate what he can and cannot eat. So AITA for asking my roommate to stop cooking and microwaving fish at home so frequently?"
771,1jojau1,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling someone’s unattended child to stop disrespecting our home,"im 18f, have a 19 month old child, and i live at my stepmothers with three of my siblings. right now one of my other sisters is visiting from my moms. my siblings thatre all currently here are 10f, 8m, 5m, and 3f, almost 4. the 3f sister A, has a neighbor friend, E, the same age as her. 
me and my stepmother (36f) were inside cleaning and i was taking care of my toddler. 

A and E are both very smart kids, talk well, they get into fights. they were fighting outside while my 10F sister was out with them. i made my sister give E her coat back. after that, A came back inside. E kept trying to bust in the house. banging on the door, while A was blocking it crying telling her she doesn’t want her in. at this point E’s mother isn’t in my view, idk where she is, likely downstairs. we live in an apartment, and my stepmom has already told E she can’t come inside. i asked A if she wanted to play and A said no. 

now here i MAY be wrong, i used a pretty big word she may not understand. i got on her level and told her that she “was already told she’s not allowed in, my sister doesn’t want to play, she needs to stop banging on our door and trying to break in. it’s not okay to disrespect someone else’s home. M (my stepmom) is cleaning and doesn’t want anyone over right now.”

now i more so meant disrespecting rules, i tried to effectively get my point across. my voice was stern, not mean. but her mom came up and told me i was being rude. and angrily left with her kid, before i could say anything. i don’t think i was rude. her kid has come over and my stepmom has almost yelled at her over how bad she doesn’t listen. she screams loud and whines and doesn’t listen to “no.” now yea they’re toddlers but i know with the amount of siblings i have, not all of them act so entitled. i’ve grown up with a lot of kids. E has personally pissed off my kid and fucked with him til he cries (she means well, but tell her no repeatedly), so honestly im not a fan of her. i was already having a bad day as my stepmom was arguing with me about something. so a little kid fucking with my sister and trying to shove herself into a house she’s not allowed in was irritating. i didn’t yell, didn’t swear, didn’t call her child anything. my stepmoms only idea is i maybe sounded too stern and used too big a word with the child (disrespect), but said her mom probably didn’t see the whole ordeal, and maybe i was right. so what do u think cause now im mad as that’s the first time some kids mom has called me rude while handling their child, and i feel it was totally unjustified.

I am very close with my mom and stepdad and we have a great relationship. I have my own home with my bf (24) and we both work full time at our jobs with 2 dogs. Both mine and my bf's job allows us a 3 day weekend every week. We only work Mon.-Thurs. My moms babysitter is not reliable and they plan on switching but cannot switch until after the summer is over . It just so happens almost every time the babysitter cancels for the day, it tends to be on a Friday and I usually will tell my mom I can watch my little sister on my day off, though I don't love it. I love my little sister but watching a one year old can be exhausting. Especially while tending dogs. Well this week, my little sister caught RSV and my parents need help with babysitting. Monday, I watched her for 7 hours on my unpaid vacation day from work, I have the whole week off it's just all unpaid. That day, I was originally told I only had to watch my sister for 4 hours. That clearly didn't happen. Next week, I already said I would watch her again on Friday. Well after I had watched my little sister that Monday, they also need me for Tuesday, again on my unpaid vacation day. This time I said no. It's not that I don't want to help them, I do. But my bf took off on Monday for us to hang out and I wasn't home all day due to watching the baby. Now Tuesday? I feel taken advantage of as an older sister. I didn't sign up to watch my sister all the time when they announced they were pregnant. Sometimes when I say no, my mom guilt trips me and make me feel like I am selfish and don't want to be around my sister but that's not the case. My life is exhausting and I need a break. I don't think it's selfish to not want to babysit on my days off when I am not getting paid and have my own life and priorities. So... AITA?"

774,1joilli,Asshole,AITA for getting Bob Dylan tickets,"So Bob Dylan's coming to play a concert near me (in MN where he hasn't performed for a long time and where might not again for a long time either). I'm in college and don't have a car but I have a friend who does. We originally were going to get tickets together but then when we saw they were super expensive (like $500) we decided not to. That was a few months ago -- today, I started thinking I really would like to go and checked again and the tickets were $100. I asked my friend and he wasn't very into it. He said Bob Dylan would sound bad and weird and depressing (I agree, that's why I want to go) and that on principle he did not want to spend any money on something he might not enjoy. Because this seems like a once in a life time thing and I thought it would be if nothing else a very interesting experience and I tried to talk him into it. He said that he would agree to go if I paid for gas and both tickets. With this in mind, I got the tickets, (though, as he wants me to add, I did not tell him before doing it). I then said that while I had no expectation of it, it would be nice if I could get paid back a little bit (as money is not always so easy to come by for college students). He said he would pay for about half of his ticket but then said that I put him in a very uncomfortable situation. By buying the tickets and then asking for him to pay for any part of it, it put him in a situation where he said he could not come off as a good friend without paying, which meant I essentially forced him to pay. Thoughts?

775,1joho9n,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I kept some of my paternal inheritance,"Despite being full siblings, my brother (33M) and I (30F) grew up separately. He was essentially abandoned by my mother who met a new husband while pregnant with me. He on the other hand was raised by our paternal grandfather whom in his later years required a caretaker. There was an unspoken agreement between all of my paternal family members that my brother would pay for the caretaker in exchange for getting to keep the house where his wife and new baby currently reside. I initially agreed for him to simply take over my portion of the house and he could have it. Of course that did not happen and due to foreign laws I do not know much of, his wife has had to put an offer on their home. As a result, I am to be paid out 1/8 of my share of the home. 

Our mother is adamant that I return all of it to them but in smaller increments over the course of years to avoid “suspicion.” This has me worrying that I am somehow participating in some illegal activity. I proposed then that I pay back the maximum allowed for this year and that her and my stepdad each pay back a bit as well and that they take it out of my half of the inheritance (which they have discussed previously). My mother has taken great offense to this stating I am not entitled to money from her and my stepdad and have no right to be discussing this with them. 

What bothers me the most through this is the hypocrisy and favoritism. While my mother did abandon my brother she always bemoaned my existence, wishing she had my brother with her instead. My basic medical needs such as dentist visits and glasses were treated as a huge burden despite them being quite wealthy. When I needed glasses in the first grade my stepfather said I looked like a frog and four-eyes and my mother told me i deserved the scolding. She also has always talked about how I’m the reason she couldn’t finish her PhD and had to settle for a master due to being pregnant with me. 

I feel the need to include this context because I feel that my entire childhood has been seen as a transaction and that I was costing them so much money and time. But now that my inheritance is up for grabs it’s unthinkable that I keep any money and that I’m suddenly greedy and desperate. 

Like most other people I really could use this money as I’m hoping to go back to school. I also realize that my brother is also a victim here which is why I’m not planning on keeping the whole 1/8. At the same time I’m somewhat bitter he’ll get a portion of my mother and stepfather large inheritance despite not having to suffer their abuse and negligence while I am being told that I am not entitled to anything from my paternal or maternal sides.

776,1johgz5,Not the A-hole,AITA for keeping my former roommates deposit out of spite?,"I (F 29) started living with my former roommate “Jessica” (F 32) back in 2022 up until March of 2023. She had to leave unexpectedly and had to find someone to sublet her room fast. Because we didn’t have the luxury of taking our time, she decided to not only forfeit her deposit, but also let the person who sublet her room put half the amount of the actual deposit ($200 instead of $400). My new roommate “Stacey” (F 28) stayed with me for about almost 2 years before things turned sour. I won’t get into detail for the sake of the story but she was very controlling and made multiple rules on what I could and could not do in the apartment, even though I was there first. I finally put my foot down after a year and a half of her telling me what I could and couldn’t do in the apartment and that’s when she absolutely snapped. A month or two after this incident happened, she decided she could no longer live in the apartment and had to leave. She told me she would do the same thing my former roommate did and find someone to sublet her room. The only problem was the lease was supposed to be up in May and she decided to leave February 22nd (her official last day was March 15 but stopped living in the apartment February 22nd). Now she is asking for her deposit back and I don’t want to give it to her since she broke the lease. I also don’t want to give it to her since it wouldn’t be fair to my old roommate who also broke the lease and never got her deposit back either. I would be lying if I also said wouldn’t want to keep it out of spite, however I know that that wouldn’t be a reasonable thing to do. However, she left before the lease was up which gives me more incentive to keep it. Am I the asshole?"
777,1jogh67,Not enough info,WIBTA for inviting people to my parents’ house?,"Is this weird? I (29F) have 2 kids (6M, 2F). I’ve become friends with the moms of several of my  son’s friends from school. We all have 2-4 kids. Four of us moms want to get together with all our kids, but that would be 11 kids. I live in a small home in the suburbs. My parents have a huge house with land. I suggested to my husband (30M) that we host at my parents’ house now and then. My parents are really good people and I know that they’re ok with this. He said it would be weird to do that and it would make me an AH for inviting 11 kids for a casual get together at my parents house. He said the other moms will think that is weird. He said we should do it at our house. I really don’t have the space for 11 rowdy kids and I want them to be able to run around outside with lots of space and climb trees & play in the mud. I know my parents are okay with it already. Would it be weird? WIBTA?"
